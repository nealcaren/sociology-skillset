# Framing Your Campus Protest Decline Paper: Two Paths

**To:** Marty
**From:** Neal
**Re:** How to frame the CCC campus protest paper — flagship journals vs. social movement journals

---

Your paper documents the dramatic decline of campus protests between 2024 and 2025, using CCC data with public/private institution type and red/blue state context. The core question is: **where do you send it, and how does that change everything?**

The venue choice isn't just about prestige — it determines what kind of contribution you're making and how you frame the entire article. Based on genre analysis of 197 articles across six journals, flagship and field-specific journals reward fundamentally different contribution types. This memo walks through both paths.

## The Fork: What Kind of Contribution Are You Making?

| | Path A: Social Movement Journals | Path B: Flagship Journals |
|---|---|---|
| **Target venues** | *Mobilization*, *Social Movement Studies* | *ASR*, *AJS*, *Social Problems*, *Social Forces* |
| **Viable contribution types** | Gap-Filler (21% of SM articles), Factor-Identifying (30%), Concept-Building (34%) | Process-Tracing (~27%), Factor-Identifying (~24%), Concept-Building (~27%) |
| **What the data needs to do** | Document a pattern the field hasn't seen | Explain HOW or WHY something works, or adjudicate competing accounts |
| **Theoretical ambition** | Can be moderate — the empirical picture can carry the paper | Must be high — the data must speak to general social theory |
| **Gap-Filler risk** | Low — GF is routine and accepted | High — GF is rare at AJS (6%) and ASR (6%); risky without reframing |
| **Audience** | Specialists who know SM theory; don't define basic concepts | Generalists who need context; define your terms |

# PATH A: Social Movement Journals

**Best if**: The empirical pattern is the main contribution — the CCC data showing what happened to campus protest, and how the decline varied by institution type and state politics. You're not proposing a new theory; you're documenting something the field hasn't seen.

**Contribution type**: Gap-Filler or Factor-Identifying (both well-accepted at SM venues).

SM readers are specialists. They don't need to be told that protests matter. Stakes-led openings ("The right to protest is fundamental to democracy...") are rare (~8%). The audience is pre-committed. Assume familiarity with repertoires, political opportunity, protest cycles.

## Path A Introduction

### Pick the right opening strategy

Two SM structural patterns fit your paper:

#### Option A1: Movement-Wave Survey (Gap-Filler)

The most common SM opening (~31%). Name the broader wave of campus protest, survey instances, then narrow to the puzzle of decline.

**Structure:**
1. Name the wave/cycle/era
2. Survey multiple instances (campuses, movements, issues)
3. Establish panoramic scope
4. Narrow to the puzzle of decline

**Example opening logic:**

> "Campus protest surged in [period], with mobilizations at [types of institutions] around [issues]. Yet by 2025, [dramatic decline]. This article examines [what happened and why]."

**Benchmarks:** ~630 words median, 3–5 paragraphs, mention data in the intro, cite in paragraph 1 (76%). Roadmap is venue-dependent: include for *SMS* (~69%), omit for *Mobilization* (~22%).

**Best when**: The CCC data showing what happened is the story.

#### Option A2: Field-Reflexive Pivot (Factor-Identifying)

The second most common SM opening (~26%). Engage SM theory directly and diagnose what the field has missed.

**Structure:**
1. State how SM has approached protest cycles/demobilization
2. Diagnose a limitation or blind spot
3. Propose adjudication criteria
4. Preview the contribution

**Example opening logic:**

> "Social movement scholars have developed robust theories of protest escalation, but the dynamics of rapid demobilization remain undertheorized. One camp argues decline is driven by state repression; another emphasizes internal movement dynamics. The speed of the 2024–2025 campus protest collapse offers a natural test."

**Best when**: The red/blue state and public/private patterns let you adjudicate between competing explanations — repression vs. internal dynamics, institutional vs. political context.

### General SM introduction conventions

- **Keep it short.** ~630 words, 3–5 paragraphs.
- **Roadmaps are venue-dependent.** *SMS* ~69%; *Mobilization* ~22%.
- **Cite in your first paragraph.** ~76% of SM articles do.
- **Frame the gap theoretically.** "No one has looked at this" isn't enough. SM readers want to know what the decline means for theory.
- **Assume specialist vocabulary.** Don't define repertoires, political opportunity structures, or protest cycles.

## Path A Theory Section

**Key SM difference**: The dominant arc structure is **building-blocks** (52%), assembling concepts sequentially rather than funneling from broad to narrow. Dialogue arcs (Position A vs. Position B) are absent (0%) in SM venues.

A second distinctive feature: 32% of SM theory sections weave case material into the theoretical discussion. This is legitimate, provided each case reference advances the argument.

### If Gap-Filler (pairs with Movement-Wave Survey intro)

**Architecture:** Building-blocks arc, ~1,000–1,400 words, 6–10 paragraphs, 0–2 subsections.

**Paragraph sequence:**
1. **Establish the phenomenon** (1–2 paras). Situate campus protest within the broader cycle. You can weave CCC data into this section — 32% of SM theory sections do this.
2. **Build the conceptual blocks** (2–3 paras). Block 1 = protest cycles and demobilization; Block 2 = institutional variation (public/private); Block 3 = state-level political context and repression.
3. **Mark the turn** (1 para). Gap statement (40% of SM articles) or limitation critique (24%, strong at *Mobilization*): "Yet the dynamics of rapid demobilization remain largely unexplored, particularly how institutional characteristics and state-level political contexts mediate the pace and extent of protest decline."
4. **State your questions** (1 para). Consider numbered hypotheses if quantitative (40% of SM articles include them).

| Feature | Target |
|---------|--------|
| Word count | 1,000–1,400 |
| Unique citations | 25–35 |
| Literature balance | Substantive-heavy or balanced |
| Hedging on gap claim | Assertive |

### If Factor-Identifying (pairs with Field-Reflexive Pivot intro)

**Architecture:** Building-blocks arc, ~1,000–1,600 words, 6–12 paragraphs.

**Paragraph sequence:**
1. **Build Block 1**: Present the repression/chilling effects literature
2. **Build Block 2**: Present the internal dynamics literature (burnout, issue fatigue, strategic retreat)
3. **Show the tension**: Brief paragraph noting competing predictions
4. **Position your study**: "This study uses CCC data to evaluate whether decline patterns vary systematically by political context (supporting repression accounts) or appear uniformly (supporting internal dynamics accounts)."

**Important**: Do NOT use a dialogue arc. Build each competing account as a separate block, then show the tension. SM readers expect building-blocks, not Point/Counterpoint.

## Path A Conclusion

SM articles typically use a standalone "Conclusion" rather than separate Discussion + Conclusion (~66%). Plan for 350–1,130 words (median ~700).

- **Open with findings summary** (~57%). "This study examined X and found Y."
- **State the contribution** (required). "This study contributes to our understanding of protest demobilization by documenting how [pattern]" (GF) or "These findings support [account] over [rival account]" (FI).
- **Include future directions** (~81%; near-universal at *Mobilization* at ~97%).
- **Limitations**: *Mobilization* ~82%; *SMS* ~20%. Match to venue.
- **Skip policy implications** unless problem-driven (only ~19% include them).
- **Callback to introduction** (~89%).
- **End with a field-reflexive coda** (~44%): "Scholars of protest cycles will need to attend to the role of institutional type in mediating demobilization."

# PATH B: Flagship Journals

**Best if**: The findings tell us something genuinely new about how political opportunity, repression, or institutional mediation works — not just in the campus context, but as general social theory. The empirical decline is the vehicle; the theoretical insight is the destination.

**Contribution type**: You need Process-Tracing, Factor-Identifying, or Concept-Building. Gap-Filler alone is risky (6% at AJS, 6% at ASR).

Flagship readers are generalists. They may study inequality, culture, organizations — not necessarily movements. You need to make them care about campus protest, and you do that by connecting to broader theoretical questions.

## Path B: Three Framing Options

### Option B1: Factor-Identifying (Adjudication)

**Punchline**: Not X but Y. Your red/blue state and public/private data let you adjudicate competing accounts of protest decline.

**How it works**: Frame two (or three) competing explanations for rapid demobilization — state repression, institutional governance, internal dynamics — and show which one the data supports. The CCC data becomes a natural experiment.

**Introduction** (~750–950 words):
- Open with the phenomenon (campus protest decline — phenomenon-led, 74% of flagship intros)
- Establish that scholars disagree about what drives rapid demobilization
- Name the competing accounts explicitly
- Preview that the public/private × red/blue variation discriminates between them
- No roadmap needed unless the paper is complex

**Theory section** (~1,400–1,800 words):
- Funnel arc (the flagship default, not building-blocks)
- Give each competing account equal theoretical weight
- Show what each predicts about institutional and political variation
- The turn: "Existing studies cannot discriminate between these accounts because they lack cross-institutional variation in political context. The 2024–2025 campus protest decline, observed across public and private institutions in both red and blue states, provides a natural test."

**Conclusion** (~1,200–1,500 words):
- Affirm which account the evidence supports
- Explain why the losing account falls short
- Extend to implications beyond campus protest — what does this tell us about repression/demobilization writ large?
- Callback to opening phenomenon

**Best for**: *ASR* (FI ~21%), *SP/SF* (FI ~22%), *AJS* (FI ~27%).

**Signal phrases**: "contrary to," "not X but Y," "which factor explains."

### Option B2: Process-Tracing (Mechanism)

**Punchline**: Shows HOW rapid demobilization works, step by step.

**How it works**: Name a mechanism — something like "institutional chill" or "cascading demobilization" — and trace how political signals translate into protest suppression through institutional intermediaries.

**Introduction** (~900–1,400 words, the AJS mode):
- Open with phenomenon or case (a specific campus, a specific moment of collapse)
- Name the mechanism within the first 2–4 paragraphs
- Develop the mechanism over 2–4 paragraphs (this is distinctive to AJS/ASR — don't do this at SM venues)
- No roadmap, no contribution list

**Theory section** (~1,400–1,800 words):
- Derive the mechanism steps from existing theory
- Show how political opportunity + institutional structure + repression chain together
- Each step should be named and traceable in the data

**Findings**: Organized by mechanism stages, not by variable or theme.

**Conclusion** (~1,200–2,200 words):
- Affirm the mechanism worked
- Use the mechanism's name
- Extend to new domains ("If institutional chill operates on campuses, where else might it suppress mobilization?")
- Zero deflation — if you name a mechanism, you must deliver it

**Best for**: *AJS* (PT ~33%), *ASR* (PT ~24%).

**Signal phrases**: "works through," "the mechanism by which," "produces."

**Risk**: You need to actually trace a multi-step process. If the data shows patterns but not stages, FI is safer.

### Option B3: Concept-Building

**Punchline**: Names WHAT is happening with a new term.

**How it works**: Coin a concept — "institutional chill," "partisan demobilization," "governance-mediated repression" — that captures something the existing vocabulary misses. The concept must do work in the analysis.

**Introduction** (~800–1,000 words):
- Open with phenomenon
- Motivate the conceptual lacuna: why don't existing terms (repression, chilling effects, movement decline) capture what's happening?
- Introduce the coined term and define it
- Preview how the concept organizes the analysis

**Theory section** (~1,500–2,000 words):
- Building-blocks arc: assemble the components of the new concept
- Show what existing concepts miss
- Define the concept's dimensions and boundaries
- The turn: "We introduce [concept] to capture [what existing vocabulary cannot]"

**Findings**: Organized by concept dimensions.

**Conclusion**: Consolidate the concept, show portability to other contexts.

**Best for**: *ASR* (CB 32% — the modal type), *AJS* (CB ~27%).

**Signal phrases**: "we introduce," "we term," "the concept of."

**Risk**: The concept must do genuine work. If "institutional chill" just means "repression by universities," it's jargon, not a contribution. The concept needs to capture something the existing vocabulary cannot.

## Path B Conclusion Conventions

Flagship conclusions are longer and do heavier work than SM conclusions:

| Feature | SM Venues | Flagships |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Word count | ~700 median | ~1,173 median |
| Limitations | Venue-dependent (20–82%) | ~69% |
| Future directions | ~81% | ~76% |
| Callback | ~89% | **100%** |
| Policy implications | ~19% | More common if problem-driven |

## Decision Guide

| Question | If yes... |
|----------|-----------|
| Is the main story the empirical pattern of decline? | **Path A (SM venues), Gap-Filler** |
| Does the data adjudicate between competing explanations? | **Either path, Factor-Identifying** — but sharper at flagships |
| Can you name a multi-step mechanism? | **Path B (flagships), Process-Tracing** — unusual at SM venues |
| Can you coin a term that captures something new? | **Path B (flagships), Concept-Building** — domain-specific CB also works at SM venues |
| Are the findings context-specific to campus protest? | Leans **Path A** — SM readers value context-bound contributions |
| Do the findings speak to general social theory? | Leans **Path B** — flagships want generalizable insight |

### My Take

The data's natural strength — CCC showing the decline across institution types and state contexts — supports **Factor-Identifying** at either venue type. The red/blue × public/private variation is a natural adjudication design. The question is scope:

- **At *Mobilization***: Frame as adjudicating within SM theory (repression vs. internal dynamics). FI is the plurality mode there (38%). Use building-blocks arc. Moderate threading. Include limitations.
- **At a flagship**: Frame as adjudicating competing accounts of how political context mediates rapid demobilization, with implications beyond campus protest. Funnel arc. Strong threading. Higher word counts. Must connect to general theory.

If you want to aim high, **FI at a flagship** (especially *SP/SF*, which has the most balanced distribution) is the strongest positioning. If the theoretical stakes feel like a stretch, **FI or GF at *Mobilization*** is a strong, well-calibrated submission.

Happy to talk through any of this.
