# Corpus Statistics

Summary of the 83-article analysis corpus drawn from Social Forces and Social Problems.

## Sample Composition

| Method type | N articles | N usable in full corpus |
|-------------|-----------|------------------------|
| Secondary-survey-analysis | 30 | 273 |
| Content-analysis | 23 | 23 |
| Administrative-data | 30 | 81 |
| **Total** | **83** | **377** |

All articles are from Social Forces or Social Problems, spanning approximately 2018-2024.

## Section-Level Statistics

| Metric | Median | 25th pct | 75th pct | Range |
|--------|--------|----------|----------|-------|
| Word count | 4,950 | ~3,000 | ~8,000 | 500-17,000+ |
| Paragraphs | 18 | 12 | 28 | 5-68 |
| Tables/figures referenced | 3 | 2 | 5 | 1-12 |
| Subsections | 3 | 1 | 5 | 1-13 |

## Organizational Strategy Distribution

| Strategy | N | % |
|----------|---|---|
| Mixed (combines multiple) | 55 | 66% |
| Model progression | 12 | 14% |
| Substantive theme | 8 | 10% |
| Chronological | 3 | 4% |
| Hypothesis-driven | 2 | 2% |
| Outcome-variable | 2 | 2% |
| Comparison-group | 1 | 1% |

Note: "Mixed" is the plurality because most articles combine strategies — e.g., descriptive overview + model progression + robustness. The clusters capture these common combinations.

## Opening Move Distribution

| Opening | N | % |
|---------|---|---|
| Table reference | 48 | 58% |
| Sample description | 17 | 20% |
| Hypothesis restatement | 12 | 14% |
| Methodological setup | 4 | 5% |
| Main finding first | 1 | 1% |

## Closing Move Distribution

| Closing | N | % |
|---------|---|---|
| Robustness checks | 15 | 18% |
| Strongest finding | 15 | 18% |
| Subgroup analysis | 14 | 17% |
| Supplemental reference | 12 | 14% |
| Summary paragraph | 9 | 11% |
| Mechanism test | 8 | 10% |
| Transition to discussion | 7 | 8% |

## Table/Figure Strategy

| Strategy | N | % |
|----------|---|---|
| Hybrid | 62 | 75% |
| Table-driven | 12 | 14% |
| Narrative-driven | 7 | 8% |
| Figure-driven | 2 | 2% |

## Theory-to-Results Linking

| Density | N | % |
|---------|---|---|
| Heavy | 46 | 55% |
| Moderate | 33 | 40% |
| Minimal | 4 | 5% |

## Cluster Distribution

| Cluster | ~N | % | Primary methods |
|---------|-----|---|----------------|
| Progressive Model Builder | 28 | 34% | Survey, Admin |
| Subgroup Comparator | 16 | 19% | All |
| Thematic Explorer | 15 | 18% | Content analysis |
| Hypothesis Tester | 12 | 14% | Survey |
| Causal Inference Specialist | 12 | 14% | Admin data |
| Decomposition Analyst | 11 | 13% | Admin, Survey |
| Temporal Tracker | 9 | 11% | Admin, Content |

Note: Some articles fit multiple clusters; percentages sum to >100%.

## Move Frequency Ranking

Ranked by how frequently each standardized move appears across the corpus:

1. BASELINE (most common)
2. DESCRIBE
3. ELABORATE
4. SUBGROUP
5. ROBUSTNESS
6. MECHANISM
7. COMPARISON
8. THEMATIC
9. TEMPORAL
10. SETUP
11. DECOMPOSE
12. VISUAL
13. SUMMARY
14. TRANSITION (least common)

## Cross-Cutting Patterns

1. ~70% of articles open with a table reference
2. Descriptive statistics appear in opening 1-3 paragraphs of ~75% of articles
3. Robustness checks appear in 65%+ of quantitative articles
4. Magnitude contextualization is nearly universal (85%+)
5. 55% include subgroup heterogeneity analysis
6. Supplemental material references in 40% of articles
7. "Mechanism" language appears in 50% of articles even without formal mediation
8. Explicit hypothesis testing in only ~15%
