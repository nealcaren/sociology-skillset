# Thematic Explorer

~15/83 articles. Exclusively content-analysis papers. Organized around substantive themes rather than statistical models.

## Defining Feature

Findings are presented through thematic analysis: the section moves through substantive themes, frames, or types identified in textual data. Evidence includes frequencies, quotations, and narrative interpretation. This is the structurally most flexible cluster.

## Canonical Arc

```
THEMATIC (theme 1) → THEMATIC (theme 2) → THEMATIC (theme 3) → COMPARISON or SUMMARY
```

## Paragraph Budget

Highly variable. Typical: 20-60+ paragraphs organized by theme.

| Move | Paragraphs | Share |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Overview/coding scheme | 2-3 | 10% |
| Theme 1 | 5-15 | 25% |
| Theme 2 | 5-15 | 25% |
| Theme 3 | 5-15 | 25% |
| COMPARISON or SUMMARY | 2-4 | 15% |

Number of themes varies: typically 3-6 major themes.

## Opening Move

**Sample description or coding scheme reference**: Establish the data and coding framework before diving into themes.

Example pattern:
> Table 1 summarizes the distribution of [codes/frames/themes] across the [N] [documents/articles/cases]. The most prevalent theme is [X] (N=Y, Z%), followed by [A] (N=B, C%).

## Closing Move

**Summary synthesizing themes** or **comparison across groups/sources**: End by pulling the thematic strands together or showing how themes vary across subgroups.

## Signature Techniques

1. **Extended direct quotations**: Use verbatim excerpts (typically block-quoted, 2-5 sentences) as primary evidence. Each theme should include 2-4 illustrative quotations.

2. **Narrative vignettes and case examples**: Develop one case in depth to illustrate a theme before showing it appears across cases.

3. **Typological presentation with exemplars**: Define the type, give its prevalence, then walk through the best example in detail.

4. **Thematic clustering with frequency quantification**: Combine qualitative interpretation with counts: "Of the 47 articles that addressed [topic], 31 (66%) framed it as [X]."

5. **Theoretical framing of discourse patterns**: Continuously interpret what the patterns *mean* through the theoretical lens — not just what they are.

## Theory Linking

Heavy. This is the most theory-saturated cluster. Interpretation is woven into every thematic discussion. Theory is not just invoked but used as an active analytical tool.

## Table Strategy

Narrative-driven or hybrid. Tables show frequencies, but the prose does the primary interpretive work through quotations, examples, and theoretical reading.

## Common Pitfalls

- Letting themes become mere containers for quotations without analytical interpretation
- Presenting themes as disconnected when they interact or reinforce each other
- Using only one exemplar per theme (show breadth with 2-4 cases, depth with 1 extended case)
- Forgetting to quantify: even qualitative content analysis benefits from prevalence counts
