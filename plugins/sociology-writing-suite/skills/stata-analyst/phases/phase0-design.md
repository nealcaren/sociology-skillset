# Phase 0: Research Design Review

You are executing Phase 0 of a statistical analysis in Stata. Your goal is to establish a credible research design before any estimation occurs.

## Why This Phase Matters

The identification strategy determines whether results have a causal interpretation. No amount of sophisticated estimation can fix a flawed design. This phase ensures the user has thought through their approach before investing in analysis.

## Your Tasks

### 1. Clarify the Research Question

Ask the user to articulate:
- What is the main question? (causal or descriptive)
- What is the outcome of interest?
- What is the key explanatory variable or treatment?
- What is the population of interest?

Document this clearly—it guides all subsequent decisions.

### 2. Identify the Estimation Strategy

Based on the research question and data structure, determine the appropriate approach:

| Strategy | When to Use | Key Assumptions | Stata Command |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **DiD** | Treatment timing varies | Parallel trends | `reghdfe`, `csdid` |
| **Event Study** | Dynamic effects needed | Same as DiD | `csdid_estat event` |
| **IV** | Endogenous treatment | Exclusion, relevance | `ivreg2`, `ivreghdfe` |
| **RD** | Threshold-based treatment | Continuity | `rdrobust` |
| **Matching** | Selection on observables | No hidden bias | `psmatch2`, `cem` |
| **Panel FE** | Time-invariant confounders | Strict exogeneity | `reghdfe`, `xtreg` |

For each strategy, reference the relevant technique guide:
- DiD/Event Study: `stata-statistical-techniques/01_core_econometrics.md`
- IV: `stata-statistical-techniques/01_core_econometrics.md` Section 4
- Matching: `stata-statistical-techniques/01_core_econometrics.md` Section 5
- Synthetic Control: `stata-statistical-techniques/03_synthetic_control.md`

### 3. Assess Assumptions

For the chosen strategy, discuss:

**What must be true for this to work?**
- State each assumption in plain language
- Discuss whether it's plausible in this context
- Identify what evidence could support or undermine it

**What are the main threats?**
- Confounders (what else might explain the relationship?)
- Selection (are treated/control groups comparable?)
- Reverse causality (could the outcome affect treatment?)
- Measurement (are variables measured accurately?)

### 4. Plan Robustness Checks

Based on identified threats, plan how to address them:
- Placebo tests (outcomes that shouldn't be affected)
- Alternative specifications (different controls, FE structures)
- Wild cluster bootstrap (if few clusters)
- Subgroup analysis (heterogeneous effects)

### 5. Document Data Requirements

Specify what the data must contain:
- Unit identifiers
- Time identifiers (if panel)
- Treatment indicators and timing
- Outcome variables
- Key controls
- Clustering variable for standard errors

## Output: Design Memo

Create a design memo (`memos/phase0-design-memo.md`) containing:

```markdown
