# Thematic Integrator

The most common cluster (35/84 articles, 42%). Organizes findings by conceptual themes rather than by method. Quantitative and qualitative evidence are woven together within each thematic subsection so the reader encounters both data types as part of a unified argument.

## Defining Feature

Findings are structured around substantive themes or concepts, not around methods. Within each theme, quantitative evidence (regression coefficients, descriptive statistics, survey results) and qualitative evidence (interview excerpts, field notes, case examples) appear side by side. The integration itself is the argument: neither method alone would be sufficient.

## Canonical Arc

```
THEMATIC (theme 1) → ILLUSTRATE → BASELINE → ELABORATE →
COMPARISON → THEMATIC (theme 2) → ILLUSTRATE → MECHANISM
```

Variant: Some articles front-load a brief DESCRIBE or BASELINE move before entering thematic structure, especially when the quantitative component involves regression models. This produces a hybrid: BASELINE → THEMATIC → ILLUSTRATE → THEMATIC → ILLUSTRATE → MECHANISM.

## Paragraph Budget

| Move | Paragraphs | Share | Method |
|------|-----------|-------|--------|
| THEMATIC (theme 1) | 4-7 | 25% | Mixed |
| ILLUSTRATE | 2-3 | 10% | Qual |
| BASELINE / ELABORATE | 3-5 | 20% | Quant |
| COMPARISON | 2-3 | 10% | Mixed |
| THEMATIC (theme 2) | 4-7 | 20% | Mixed |
| ILLUSTRATE | 2-3 | 10% | Qual |
| MECHANISM | 1-2 | 5% | Mixed |

Total: 18-30 paragraphs typical. Number of thematic subsections varies (typically 3-5).

## Opening Move

**Qualitative vignette** (46%) or **hypothesis restatement** (31%).

Vignette pattern:
> Maria, a 34-year-old community organizer in East Los Angeles, described the moment she first encountered [phenomenon]: "We had been fighting for this for years, and when it finally happened, nobody knew what to do." Her experience illustrates a broader pattern visible in both the survey data and our fieldwork: [generalize to theme].

Hypothesis restatement pattern:
> We proposed that [concept] would shape [outcome] through two distinct pathways. The qualitative and quantitative evidence presented below converges on this claim, while also revealing an unanticipated dimension.

## Closing Move

**Integration summary** or **qualitative synthesis** (57% combined).

Integration summary pattern:
> Taken together, the regression results and interview data converge on three conclusions. First, [finding 1 with both evidence types]. Second, [finding 2]. Third, [finding 3 with mechanism evidence]. The qualitative evidence is particularly important for understanding [aspect] that the statistical models cannot capture.

Qualitative synthesis pattern:
> Returning to the experiences of respondents like Maria, these findings suggest that [phenomenon] is not simply a matter of [quantitative pattern] but reflects [deeper qualitative insight]. As several respondents articulated, [closing quotation that encapsulates the argument].

## Signature Techniques

1. **Vignette-then-generalize**: Open a thematic section with a detailed case or interview excerpt, then show the pattern is widespread using quantitative evidence. "Maria's experience is not unique. Among respondents in the top quartile of [variable], 68% reported..."

2. **Quant-qual juxtaposition**: Present a statistical finding and immediately follow with qualitative evidence that deepens or complicates it. "While the regression shows a significant positive effect (b = .34, p < .01), interviews reveal that this aggregate pattern masks two distinct processes..."

3. **Extended quotation as analytical anchor**: Block-quote a substantial passage (50-100 words), then devote 2-3 sentences to analytical interpretation connecting it to the theme and to quantitative patterns.

4. **Cross-case comparison within themes**: Compare 2-3 informants or cases within a single thematic section to show variation within the pattern. "While both Carlos and Fatima experienced [X], their responses diverged..."

5. **Theoretical weaving**: Each theme is framed by and returns to theory. The theme heading often uses a theoretical concept. Interpretation connects evidence to the theoretical framework continuously, not just in opening/closing paragraphs.

## Method Integration Pattern

**Elaboration** (primary) and **complementarity** (secondary). Quantitative evidence typically establishes that a pattern exists and estimates its magnitude. Qualitative evidence explains *why* the pattern exists, what it *means* to participants, and what *processes* produce it. Neither method is subordinate; they address different aspects of the same phenomenon within each theme.

## Theory Linking Density

**Heavy.** This is the most theory-saturated cluster. Theory is invoked in subsection headings, paragraph topic sentences, and interpretive passages following quotations. Expect 1-2 explicit theoretical references per thematic subsection. Theory functions as an active analytical tool for interpreting qualitative evidence, not just as a frame.

## Table/Figure Strategy

**Narrative-driven** (primary) or **hybrid**. Tables and figures support the thematic narrative but do not drive structure. A common pattern: one summary table of regression results early in the section, referenced intermittently as themes unfold; qualitative evidence tables (e.g., coding frequencies) as supplementary. Figures may show patterns that qualitative evidence then explains.

## Subsection Structure

By theme (nearly universal in this cluster). Subsection headings name the conceptual theme, often using theoretical language:
- "Boundary Work and Institutional Legitimacy"
- "The Role of Collective Identity in Mobilization"
- "Navigating Dual Identities"

Some articles use a hybrid where the first subsection presents quantitative overview, then subsequent subsections are thematic.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Parallel silos**: Presenting all quant evidence in one block and all qual evidence in another within a "thematic" subsection, rather than genuinely interweaving them paragraph by paragraph
- **Illustrative-only quotations**: Using qualitative evidence only to "show what the numbers look like in practice" rather than as independent analytical evidence that reveals processes, meanings, or mechanisms
- **Theme proliferation**: Identifying too many themes (6+) leads to thin evidence for each; 3-5 themes with deep evidence is the corpus norm
- **Missing transitions between themes**: Readers need to understand how Theme 2 relates to Theme 1 -- is it an extension, complication, or new dimension?
- **Uneven method integration**: Some themes lean heavily qual, others heavily quant, without acknowledging or justifying the asymmetry
