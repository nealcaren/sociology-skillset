# Sequential Study Design

6/84 articles (7%). Presents multiple distinct studies or analytic phases in sequence. Each study has its own internal structure (setup, results, summary) before a TRANSITION move bridges to the next study. The section reads as a series of linked but self-contained investigations.

## Defining Feature

The section is organized into discrete studies (Study 1, Study 2, Study 3) or analytic phases, each with its own method, data source, and internal arc. A later study typically builds on the findings of earlier ones: Study 1 might establish a pattern quantitatively, Study 2 investigates mechanisms qualitatively, and Study 3 tests boundary conditions with a different sample. The sequential structure makes the logic of multi-method design explicit.

## Canonical Arc

```
SETUP (Study 1) → BASELINE → ELABORATE → SUMMARY →
TRANSITION →
SETUP (Study 2) → BASELINE → ELABORATE → MECHANISM →
SUMMARY
```

For three-study designs, the pattern extends:
```
SETUP (Study 1) → BASELINE → ELABORATE → SUMMARY →
TRANSITION →
SETUP (Study 2) → THEMATIC → ILLUSTRATE → MECHANISM → SUMMARY →
TRANSITION →
SETUP (Study 3) → BASELINE → ROBUSTNESS → SUMMARY
```

## Paragraph Budget

| Move | Paragraphs | Share | Method |
|------|-----------|-------|--------|
| SETUP (Study 1) | 1-2 | 5% | Quant |
| BASELINE + ELABORATE (Study 1) | 4-6 | 25% | Quant |
| SUMMARY (Study 1) | 1 | 5% | Quant |
| TRANSITION | 1 | 5% | Bridge |
| SETUP (Study 2) | 1-2 | 5% | Qual |
| THEMATIC + ILLUSTRATE (Study 2) | 5-8 | 30% | Qual |
| MECHANISM (Study 2) | 1-2 | 10% | Qual |
| SUMMARY (Study 2) | 1 | 5% | Mixed |
| TRANSITION + SUMMARY (final) | 1-2 | 10% | Mixed |

Total: 16-25 paragraphs typical. Each study occupies 40-50% of the section; the TRANSITION paragraphs are structurally critical.

## Opening Move

**Methodological setup** (dominant).

Pattern:
> Our analysis proceeds in two stages. Study 1 uses [quantitative method] to establish the [pattern/relationship] across [N] cases. Study 2 draws on [N] in-depth interviews to examine the mechanisms underlying this pattern. We present each study's findings in turn.

Some articles open directly into Study 1 without a framing paragraph, especially when the multi-study design was explained in the Methods section.

## Closing Move

**Mechanism test** or **transition to discussion** (common). The final study's summary often serves as the section's closing, integrating across studies.

Cross-study integration pattern:
> Study 2's interview findings thus illuminate the mechanisms behind Study 1's statistical patterns. The regression-documented association between [X] and [Y] (b = .34, p < .001) reflects a process in which [mechanism description from interviews]. Across both studies, the evidence converges on [theoretical conclusion].

## Signature Techniques

1. **Study-level roadmap**: Open with a brief paragraph explaining the multi-study structure and what each study contributes. "Our analysis proceeds in three steps..."

2. **Cross-study referencing**: Later studies explicitly reference earlier findings. "Study 1 showed that [X predicts Y]. The interviews in Study 2 reveal *how* this occurs: respondents described a process in which..."

3. **Internal mini-arcs**: Each study has its own opening, body, and closing moves, creating a nested structure. The SUMMARY move at the end of each study synthesizes that study's findings before the TRANSITION.

4. **Bridging transition paragraphs**: TRANSITION paragraphs between studies do three things: (a) summarize the prior study's key finding, (b) identify what remains unexplained, and (c) introduce the next study's approach. "While Study 1 establishes that [finding], it cannot tell us *why* this pattern occurs. To examine the underlying mechanisms, we turn to our interview data."

5. **Escalating complexity**: Studies build toward greater explanatory depth. Study 1 = description/association; Study 2 = mechanism/process; Study 3 = boundary conditions or generalization test.

## Method Integration Pattern

**Sequential** (primary), typically as *extension* rather than elaboration. Each study uses a single method (or primarily one method) and addresses its own question. Integration occurs between studies rather than within them: Study 1's findings motivate Study 2's questions, and Study 2's findings reinterpret Study 1's patterns. The TRANSITION paragraphs are where integration happens rhetorically. The extension logic means each study contributes something the other *could not* -- not just a deeper look at the same question, but a genuinely different question that enriches the overall analysis.

## Theory Linking Density

**Moderate.** Theory frames the overall design (why multiple studies are needed) and appears in transition paragraphs (connecting across studies). Within each study, theory linking follows the norms of that method: moderate for quantitative studies, moderate-to-heavy for qualitative studies.

## Table/Figure Strategy

**Hybrid**, partitioned by study. The quantitative study (typically Study 1) uses tables and figures following quantitative norms (regression tables, coefficient plots). The qualitative study may include a coding table or theme frequency table. Each study's tables/figures are self-contained.

## Subsection Structure

**By study** (nearly universal). Clear section headers:
- "Study 1: [Method] Analysis of [Question]"
- "Study 2: [Method] Evidence on [Question]"

Within each study, sub-organization follows the norms of that method: model progression for quant studies, thematic organization for qual studies.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Disconnected studies**: Each study reads as a standalone paper rather than part of an integrated investigation. The TRANSITION paragraphs must do heavy lifting to connect them.
- **Weak transitions**: "We now turn to Study 2" without explaining *why* -- what question does Study 2 answer that Study 1 could not?
- **Front-loading**: Devoting 70% of space to Study 1 and rushing through Study 2. Budget roughly equal space, or weight toward the study that offers the most novel contribution.
- **Redundant methods descriptions**: If the Methods section already described each study's approach, the Results section should only briefly recap ("Using the interview data described above...") rather than re-explain sampling, coding, and analysis.
- **Missing integration summary**: After presenting individual studies, failing to provide a paragraph that synthesizes across them. The reader needs to understand what the studies collectively demonstrate.
