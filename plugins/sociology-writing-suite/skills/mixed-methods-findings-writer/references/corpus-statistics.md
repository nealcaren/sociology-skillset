## Move Frequency Ranking

Ranked by how frequently each standardized move appears across the corpus:

1. THEMATIC (most common)
2. ILLUSTRATE
3. BASELINE
4. ELABORATE
5. MECHANISM
6. COMPARISON
7. DESCRIBE
8. VISUAL
9. ROBUSTNESS
10. TRANSITION
11. SUBGROUP
12. SUMMARY
13. SETUP
14. QUALITATIVE-VIGNETTE
15. TEMPORAL
16. DECOMPOSE (least common)

## Cross-Cutting Patterns

1. Qualitative evidence occupies 60-75% of paragraph space even when quantitative findings establish core claims
2. Transition sentences between methods are crucial but only 17% of articles include them explicitly
3. Extended quotations (50+ words) function as analytical anchors, not mere illustration (61% of articles)
4. Figures/tables play different rhetorical roles across clusters (anchoring in Quant-Anchored; supporting in Thematic Integrator)
5. Opening moves predict integration patterns: vignette openers correlate with thematic integration; table-reference openers correlate with quant-anchored structure
6. Robustness checks appear in 40% of articles but only for quantitative claims
7. Theory linking varies by journal: Social Forces articles lean moderate; Social Problems articles lean heavy
8. Subgroup analysis functions as a bridge device between methods in 38% of articles
