## 1. Vignette-then-generalize (69%)

Open a theme or section with a detailed narrative case (interview excerpt, fieldwork scene, or individual story), then demonstrate the pattern's prevalence using quantitative or systematic qualitative evidence.

**Pattern**: "Maria, a community organizer in East Los Angeles, described the moment she first encountered [phenomenon]: '[quotation].' Her experience was not unusual. Among the 47 respondents who discussed [topic], 38 (81%) described a similar dynamic. The regression results confirm this pattern at the population level: [variable] is significantly associated with [outcome] (b = .34, p < .01)."

**Signal phrases**: "Her experience was not unique..." / "[Name]'s account is illustrative of a broader pattern..." / "This was typical. Among respondents..."

**Clusters**: Dominant in Thematic Integrator and Qual-Dominant Quantifier. Appears in the qualitative block of Quant-Anchored Elaborator.

## 2. Quant-qual juxtaposition (65%)

Present a statistical finding and immediately follow with qualitative evidence that deepens, complicates, or humanizes it. The juxtaposition can also run in the other direction: qualitative pattern first, then quantitative confirmation.

**Pattern**: "The regression coefficient indicates that [X] increases [Y] by .34 standard deviations (p < .001). Interviews reveal what this aggregate pattern looks like in practice. As one respondent explained: '[quotation].' This account suggests that the statistical association operates through [mechanism]."

**Reverse pattern**: "Respondents consistently described [process]. The survey data confirm this qualitative pattern: [X]% of the sample reported [behavior] (Table 3)."

**Signal phrases**: "Interviews reveal what this looks like in practice..." / "The survey data confirm this qualitative pattern..." / "Behind this coefficient lies a more complex story..."

**Clusters**: Universal across all clusters, but structurally central to Alternating Validator and Quant-Anchored Elaborator.

## 3. Extended quotation (61%)

Use substantial quotations (50+ words, often block-quoted) as analytical anchors, not mere illustrations. The quotation carries argumentative weight; the surrounding prose interprets it.

**Pattern**:

> "When they closed the plant, everything changed. Not just the jobs -- though that was devastating -- but the whole way people related to each other. Before, you could walk into any bar on Main Street and someone would know your name. After, people just... disappeared. Moved away, or stayed home, or drank. The community didn't die all at once. It died in pieces." (Interview #23, unemployed steelworker, age 54)

This passage captures the cascading nature of deindustrialization's effects on social cohesion, a process that our quantitative measures of community attachment (Table 2) can document but not fully explain. The respondent's distinction between economic loss and social dissolution maps onto the theoretical distinction between [concept A] and [concept B].

**Signal phrases**: "As [name/identifier] put it..." / "One respondent captured this dynamic particularly clearly..." / "[Name]'s account is worth quoting at length..."

**Clusters**: Central to all clusters. In Thematic Integrator and Qual-Dominant Quantifier, typically 3-5 extended quotations per thematic subsection. In Quant-Anchored Elaborator, concentrated in the qualitative block.

## 4. Model progression (58%)

Narrate what happens to focal coefficients as models become more complex. The trajectory of coefficient changes is the argument.

**Pattern**: "Model 1 includes only [focal variable] and basic demographics. In Model 2, we add [control block]; the coefficient on [focal variable] declines from .42 to .31 (a 26% reduction), suggesting that [interpretation]. In Model 3, adding [mediator] further attenuates the coefficient to .19, consistent with partial mediation through [pathway]."

**Signal phrases**: "Adding [controls] in Model 2 reduces the coefficient from... to..." / "The focal variable remains significant across all specifications..." / "The attenuation suggests that..."

**Clusters**: Dominant in Quant-Anchored Elaborator (including model-progression variant). Also appears in the quantitative block of Sequential Study Design.

## 5. Magnitude contextualization (54%)

Translate statistical coefficients into substantive units that readers can grasp: percentages, dollars, years, concrete comparisons, or percentile shifts.

**Pattern**: "A one-standard-deviation increase in neighborhood disadvantage is associated with a 14% increase in the odds of arrest -- roughly the difference between a neighborhood at the 25th and 75th percentile of the disadvantage distribution."

**Signal phrases**: "In substantive terms, this means..." / "To put this in context..." / "This is roughly equivalent to..."

**Clusters**: Present wherever quantitative findings appear. Most frequent in Quant-Anchored Elaborator and Sequential Study Design.

## 6. Coefficient interpretation (51%)

Convert statistical outputs (log odds, hazard ratios, standardized betas) into plain-language relationships. Distinct from magnitude contextualization in that it translates the statistical metric, not just the size.

**Pattern**: "The odds ratio of 1.45 indicates that respondents in the treatment group have 45% higher odds of [outcome] compared to the control group, net of [controls]."

**Signal phrases**: "The coefficient indicates that..." / "This translates to a [X]% increase in..." / "In other words, for each unit increase in [X]..."

**Clusters**: Universal in quantitative blocks.

## 7. Parallel structure (43%)

Present findings using structurally parallel language across cases, groups, or methods. The parallelism highlights comparison and makes patterns visible.

**Pattern**: "For low-income respondents, the primary barrier was [X]; among middle-income respondents, the barrier shifted to [Y]. In the regression results, this divergence appears as a significant interaction (b = .23, p < .05). In the interviews, it manifested as fundamentally different framing: low-income respondents spoke of [concept A], while middle-income respondents described [concept B]."

**Signal phrases**: "For [group A]... For [group B]..." / "In the quantitative data, this appears as... In the qualitative data, it manifests as..." / "While [group A] described... [group B] emphasized..."

**Clusters**: Prominent in Alternating Validator and Thematic Integrator.

## 8. Cross-case comparison (42%)

Explicitly compare informants, organizations, or sites that differ on a key dimension to illuminate variation within a pattern.

**Pattern**: "While both Elena and David experienced organizational downsizing, their responses diverged sharply. Elena, who had strong union ties, mobilized collective resistance: 'We weren't going to take this lying down.' David, with no union membership, pursued individual strategies: 'I just started looking for another job.' This within-pattern variation maps onto the quantitative finding that union membership moderates the effect of downsizing on collective action (Table 4, Model 3)."

**Signal phrases**: "In contrast to [case A], [case B]..." / "This within-pattern variation..." / "Comparing [case A] and [case B] illuminates..."

**Clusters**: All clusters, but structurally central to Thematic Integrator and Qual-Dominant Quantifier.

## 9. Process-tracing (38%)

Reconstruct a causal or temporal sequence by drawing on evidence from multiple informants, observations, or data points. The goal is to trace the mechanism step by step.

**Pattern**: "The process typically unfolded in three stages. First, respondents became aware of [trigger] (described by 28 of 34 participants). Second, they sought information from [source], a step that Elena described as 'the turning point.' Third, those with access to [resource] were able to [action], while those without it reported [alternative]. This three-stage process is consistent with the mediation analysis (Table 5), which shows a significant indirect effect through [mediator variable]."

**Signal phrases**: "The process typically unfolded as follows..." / "Tracing the sequence across informants..." / "This chain of events is consistent with..."

**Clusters**: Mechanism moves across all clusters. Especially prominent in Quant-Anchored Elaborator (qualitative block) and Sequential Study Design (later studies).

## 10. Interaction unpacking (32%)

Translate complex statistical interactions into interpretable predicted values, marginal effects, or contrasting scenarios, then ground them in qualitative evidence.

**Pattern**: "Figure 3 plots predicted probabilities from the interaction model. For respondents with high social capital, increasing education has little effect on participation. For those with low social capital, each additional year of education increases predicted participation by 4 percentage points. Interviews illuminate this pattern: highly connected respondents were 'pulled in' regardless of education, while less-connected respondents needed educational exposure to [specific mechanism]."

**Signal phrases**: "The interaction effect indicates that..." / "As Figure [X] shows, the relationship between [A] and [B] depends on..." / "Interviews help explain this contingency..."

**Clusters**: Quant-Anchored Elaborator and Thematic Integrator.

## 11. Descriptive quantification within qualitative themes (30%)

Embed counts, percentages, or distributional information within qualitative paragraphs to anchor interpretive claims in systematic evidence.

**Pattern**: "Nearly two-thirds of respondents (22 of 34) described encountering [barrier] during the transition period. Of these, the majority (15) framed it as [interpretation A], while a minority (7) understood it through [interpretation B]."

**Signal phrases**: "Of the [N] respondents who discussed [topic]..." / "This pattern appeared in [X] of [N] cases ([Y]%)..." / "The majority (N = [X]) described..."

**Clusters**: Dominant in Qual-Dominant Quantifier and Thematic Integrator. Used to add rigor to qualitative claims.

## 12. Method-specific transition sentences (28%)

Brief sentences or short paragraphs that explicitly mark the shift between quantitative and qualitative evidence. These are structurally important but underused -- only 17% of articles include them consistently.

**Pattern**: "Having established the statistical association between [X] and [Y], we now turn to our interview data to examine the mechanisms through which this process unfolds in practice."

**Pattern (reverse)**: "The qualitative evidence thus suggests that [process] is the primary mechanism. We now examine whether this proposed mechanism is supported by the mediation analysis."

**Signal phrases**: "We now turn to..." / "Having established... we examine..." / "The interview data illuminate..." / "Returning to the regression results..."

**Clusters**: Structurally essential in Quant-Anchored Elaborator (the TRANSITION move). Important but often missing in Alternating Validator.

## 13. Triangulation claim (25%)

Explicitly state that two independent methods reach the same conclusion, strengthening the finding's credibility.

**Pattern**: "The regression results and interview data converge on the same conclusion: [finding]. The quantitative evidence establishes the pattern's magnitude and generalizability, while the qualitative evidence confirms its experiential reality and reveals the process underlying it."

**Signal phrases**: "Both methods converge on..." / "The quantitative and qualitative evidence are consistent..." / "Triangulating across data sources..."

**Clusters**: Defining technique of Alternating Validator. Also appears in closing paragraphs of other clusters.

## 14. Null finding acknowledgment (23%)

Report and interpret non-significant quantitative results or absent qualitative patterns transparently.

**Pattern**: "Contrary to our expectation, [variable] is not significantly associated with [outcome] (b = .03, n.s.). The interview data help explain this null result: respondents described [process] that may counteract the expected effect, producing the observed near-zero association."

**Signal phrases**: "Contrary to our expectation..." / "We find no significant association..." / "This null result is informative because..."

**Clusters**: Present across clusters but less frequent than in purely quantitative work (23% vs. 45%).

## 15. Robustness cascade (21%)

Document multiple alternative specifications, samples, or measures to demonstrate that quantitative findings are stable.

**Pattern**: "Results are robust to (1) alternative measures of [IV] (Appendix Table A3), (2) restricting the sample to [subset] (Table A4), (3) using [alternative estimator] (Table A5), and (4) controlling for [potential confounder] (available upon request)."

**Signal phrases**: "Results are robust to..." / "We examined sensitivity to..." / "Alternative specifications yield substantively similar conclusions..."

**Clusters**: Primarily Quant-Anchored Elaborator and Sequential Study Design (quantitative studies).

## 16. Subgroup bridging (19%)

Use subgroup analysis as a bridge between quantitative and qualitative evidence. The regression shows the effect varies by subgroup; the qualitative evidence explains why.

**Pattern**: "Table 4 shows that the effect of [X] on [Y] is significant for women (b = .38, p < .01) but not for men (b = .05, n.s.). Interviews reveal why: women in our sample described [process] that men did not experience. As one female respondent explained: '[quotation].'"

**Signal phrases**: "The subgroup analysis raises a question that the interview data help answer..." / "The regression reveals heterogeneity; the interviews explain it..."

**Clusters**: Present across clusters. Functions as a natural integration device.

## 17. Temporal pattern description (17%)

Narrate trends, periodization, or event-study patterns, often combining quantitative time-series data with qualitative accounts of change.

**Pattern**: "Figure 2 shows a marked increase in [outcome] after 2015. Respondents who lived through this period dated the change precisely: 'Everything shifted after [event]. Before that, [prior state]; after, [new state].' The quantitative and qualitative periodizations align."

**Signal phrases**: "Over time, the pattern shifted..." / "Respondents dated the change to..." / "The trend data and interview accounts converge on the same turning point..."

**Clusters**: Present across clusters where temporal dynamics are relevant.

## 18. Typological presentation (14%)

Define a type or category, report its prevalence, then walk through the best exemplar in detail.

**Pattern**: "We identified three response types among organizations facing regulatory pressure: compliance (N = 12, 38%), symbolic adoption (N = 14, 44%), and resistance (N = 6, 19%). We illustrate each type below, beginning with the most prevalent."

**Signal phrases**: "We identified [N] types..." / "The most common pattern, which we term [label]..." / "This type was exemplified by..."

**Clusters**: Qual-Dominant Quantifier and Thematic Integrator.

## 19. Cross-method divergence acknowledgment

When quantitative and qualitative findings point in different directions, report and interpret the divergence explicitly rather than suppressing it. Divergence is analytically productive: it can reveal boundary conditions, countervailing mechanisms, or measurement limitations.

**Pattern**: "The regression results indicate a positive association between [X] and [Y] (b = .28, p < .01). The interview evidence, however, complicates this picture. Several respondents described [countervailing process]: '[quotation].' This divergence suggests that the aggregate statistical pattern may mask two distinct processes operating in opposing directions among [subgroup A] and [subgroup B]."

**Signal phrases**: "The qualitative evidence complicates this picture..." / "While the regression suggests [X], interviews reveal [Y]..." / "This divergence between the statistical and experiential evidence is analytically informative..."

**Clusters**: Present across all clusters but most analytically consequential in Alternating Validator and Quant-Anchored Elaborator. Only 23% of articles in the corpus acknowledge divergence explicitly; most suppress it, missing an analytical opportunity.

## 20. Visual-qualitative pairing (12%)

Present a figure showing a quantitative pattern, then immediately follow with qualitative evidence that explains or humanizes the pattern.

**Pattern**: "Figure 2 displays the sharp divergence in [outcome] between [groups] after 2012. What accounts for this divergence? Respondents from [group A] described [process]: '[quotation].' Those from [group B], by contrast, pointed to [alternative]: '[quotation].'"

**Signal phrases**: "As Figure [X] shows... Respondents described..." / "The figure captures the pattern; the interviews explain it..." / "Behind the trend line, respondents experienced..."

**Clusters**: Alternating Validator (structurally central) and Quant-Anchored Elaborator (bridging quant and qual blocks).
