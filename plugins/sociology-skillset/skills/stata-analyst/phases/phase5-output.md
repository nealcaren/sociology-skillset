# Phase 5: Output & Interpretation

You are executing Phase 5 of a statistical analysis in Stata. Your goal is to produce publication-ready outputs and synthesize the analysis into a coherent narrative.

## Why This Phase Matters

Analysis isn't complete until it's communicated. This phase transforms results into tables, figures, and text that can appear in a journal article. Good output is accurate, clear, and tells a story.

## Technique Guides

**Consult these guides** in `stata-statistical-techniques/` for output code patterns:

| Topic | Guide |
|-------|-------|
| Tables (esttab, estout) | `04_visualization.md` |
| Figures (coefplot, graphs) | `04_visualization.md` |
| Table 1, Descriptives | `07_postestimation_reporting.md` |
| Project structure, Master do-files | `05_best_practices.md` |
| Complete project template | `99_default_journal_pipeline.md` |

## Your Tasks

### 1. Finalize Tables

**Table 1: Descriptive Statistics**
```stata
* Summary statistics
estpost summarize outcome treatment control1 control2
esttab using "$tables/table1_descriptives.tex", replace ///
    cells("count(fmt(0)) mean(fmt(2)) sd(fmt(2)) min(fmt(2)) max(fmt(2))") booktabs ///
    title("Summary Statistics") ///
    note("Sample: [description]. Source: [data source].")

* Balance table (if applicable)
estpost ttest outcome control1 control2, by(treatment)
esttab using "$tables/table1_balance.tex", replace ///
    cells("mu_1(fmt(2)) mu_2(fmt(2)) b(fmt(2) star)") ///
    collabels("Control" "Treated" "Difference") ///
    star(* 0.10 ** 0.05 *** 0.01) booktabs ///
    title("Balance Across Treatment Groups")
```

**Table 2: Main Results**
```stata
esttab m1 m2 m3 m4 using "$tables/table2_main.tex", replace ///
    se star(* 0.10 ** 0.05 *** 0.01) booktabs ///
    keep(treatment) ///
    coeflabels(treatment "Treatment Effect") ///
    stats(N r2_a, labels("Observations" "Adj. R-squared") fmt(0 3)) ///
    mtitles("(1)" "(2)" "(3)" "(4)") ///
    title("Effect of [Treatment] on [Outcome]") ///
    addnotes("Standard errors clustered at [level] in parentheses." ///
             "All models include [FE description]." ///
             "* p<0.1, ** p<0.05, *** p<0.01")
```

**Table 3: Robustness**
```stata
esttab main robust1 robust2 robust3 robust4 using "$tables/table3_robustness.tex", replace ///
    se star(* 0.10 ** 0.05 *** 0.01) booktabs ///
    keep(treatment) ///
    mtitles("Main" "Alt 1" "Alt 2" "Alt 3" "Alt 4") ///
    title("Robustness Checks") ///
    note("See notes to Table 2.")
```

### 2. Create Publication Figures

**Figure 1: Trends (for DiD)**
```stata
preserve
collapse (mean) mean_outcome=outcome (sd) sd_outcome=outcome (count) n=outcome, ///
    by(year treatment_group)
gen se = sd_outcome / sqrt(n)
gen ci_low = mean_outcome - 1.96*se
gen ci_high = mean_outcome + 1.96*se

twoway (rarea ci_low ci_high year if treatment_group==0, color(blue%20)) ///
       (rarea ci_low ci_high year if treatment_group==1, color(red%20)) ///
       (line mean_outcome year if treatment_group==0, lcolor(blue) lwidth(medium)) ///
       (line mean_outcome year if treatment_group==1, lcolor(red) lwidth(medium)) ///
       (scatter mean_outcome year if treatment_group==0, mcolor(blue)) ///
       (scatter mean_outcome year if treatment_group==1, mcolor(red)), ///
       xline(`treatment_year', lpattern(dash) lcolor(gray)) ///
       legend(order(3 "Control" 4 "Treated") rows(1) position(6)) ///
       xtitle("Year") ytitle("Outcome") ///
       title("") ///
       graphregion(color(white)) bgcolor(white)

graph export "$figures/figure1_trends.pdf", replace
restore
```

**Figure 2: Event Study**
```stata
* After csdid estimation
csdid_plot, ///
    style(rcap) ///
    title("") ///
    xtitle("Time Relative to Treatment") ///
    ytitle("Coefficient Estimate") ///
    graphregion(color(white)) bgcolor(white)

graph export "$figures/figure2_eventstudy.pdf", replace
```

**Figure 3: Coefficient Plot**
```stata
coefplot m4, ///
    keep(treatment) ///
    xline(0, lpattern(dash) lcolor(gray)) ///
    title("") ///
    xtitle("Coefficient Estimate") ///
    graphregion(color(white)) bgcolor(white)

graph export "$figures/figure3_coefplot.pdf", replace
```

### 3. Write Results Narrative

Draft the key paragraphs for the results section:

**Main effect paragraph:**
> Table 2 presents estimates of the effect of [treatment] on [outcome].
> Column (1) shows the baseline relationship without controls.
> Column (4), our preferred specification, includes [unit] and [time] fixed effects
> and clusters standard errors at the [level] level. We find that [treatment]
> [increases/decreases] [outcome] by [X] [units], significant at the [Y]% level
> (95% CI: [lower, upper]). This represents a [Z]% change relative to the
> pre-treatment mean of [mean].

**Robustness paragraph:**
> Table 3 demonstrates that this finding is robust to alternative specifications.
> The point estimate remains [stable/similar] when we [change 1], [change 2], and
> [change 3]. The effect is [somewhat/not] sensitive to [what]. The wild cluster
> bootstrap p-value of [X] confirms that inference is [robust/sensitive] to
> the number of clusters.

**Heterogeneity paragraph (if applicable):**
> We examine heterogeneity in treatment effects across [subgroups].
> Table X shows that the effect is [larger/smaller] for [group 1]
> ([estimate]) compared to [group 2] ([estimate]). This difference is
> [statistically significant / not statistically significant] (p = [value]).

### 4. Survey Data Methods Section (If Applicable)

For survey-based analyses, address the five survey methodology deliverables:

**1. Sampling Frame Description:**
```markdown
Data come from the [SURVEY NAME], a [DESIGN TYPE] of [POPULATION].
The sampling frame is [DESCRIPTION]. The target population is [WHO].
[Exclusions]: We exclude [categories] because [reason].
```

**2. Response Rate and Nonresponse:**
```markdown
The response rate was [X]% (calculated as [METHOD: AAPOR RR1/RR3/etc.]).
We compared respondents to [population benchmark / nonrespondents on X variables]
and found [no significant differences / differences on X that we address through Y].
```

**3. Weighting Justification:**
```markdown
We apply [WEIGHT TYPE: post-stratification / raking / none] weights to adjust for
[FACTORS]. Weights are provided by [SOURCE] and calibrated to [BENCHMARKS].
[Alternative: We do not apply weights because {justification}.]
```

**4. Survey Design Acknowledgment:**
```stata
* Define survey design
svyset [pw=weight], strata(stratum) psu(psu)

* All analyses use survey-adjusted estimates
svy: mean outcome
svy: regress outcome treatment control1 control2
```

**5. Population Inference Boundaries:**
```markdown
Our results generalize to [POPULATION] during [TIME PERIOD]. We cannot
speak to [EXCLUDED GROUPS / OTHER TIME PERIODS] because [REASON].
```

### 5. Document Limitations

Identify and articulate limitations honestly:

```markdown
## Limitations

1. **[Identification limitation]**: Our identification strategy relies on
   [assumption]. While we provide evidence supporting this assumption through
   [tests], we cannot definitively rule out [threat].

2. **[External validity]**: Our sample consists of [description]. Results may
   not generalize to [other contexts] because [reason].

3. **[Measurement]**: [Variable] is measured using [method], which may
   [limitation]. We address this by [mitigation] but acknowledge [remaining concern].

4. **[Data limitation]**: We lack data on [variable], which could [potential issue].
   Our robustness checks in Table X suggest this is [unlikely to/may] affect our
   conclusions.
```

### 5. Create Replication Package

Prepare materials for reproducibility:

```stata
* Master do-file header
* ============================================================
* Replication Code for "[Paper Title]"
* Authors: [Names]
* Date: [Date]
*
* This script reproduces all tables and figures in the paper.
* Runtime: approximately [X] minutes
*
* Requirements:
* Stata version: 15+
* Packages: reghdfe, estout, coefplot, csdid
* ============================================================

version 15
clear all
set more off

* Install required packages (uncomment if needed)
* ssc install reghdfe
* ssc install estout
* ssc install coefplot
* ssc install csdid

* Set root path (CHANGE THIS)
global root "[path to replication folder]"

* Derived paths
global code "$root/code"
global data "$root/data"
global raw "$data/raw"
global clean "$data/clean"
global tables "$root/output/tables"
global figures "$root/output/figures"
global logs "$root/logs"

* Start log
log using "$logs/replication_log.txt", text replace

* Run analysis
do "$code/01_clean_data.do"
do "$code/02_descriptives.do"
do "$code/03_main_analysis.do"
do "$code/04_robustness.do"
do "$code/05_figures.do"

* Report completion
display "Replication complete: " c(current_date) " " c(current_time)
display "Stata version: " c(stata_version)

log close
```
