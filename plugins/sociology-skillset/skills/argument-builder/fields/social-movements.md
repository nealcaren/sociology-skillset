# Field Profile: Social Movements (Argument Builder)

This field profile adjusts argument-builder guidance for Theory sections targeting social movement studies venues. Based on argument-style coding of 25 articles from *Mobilization* (n=15) and *Social Movement Studies* (n=10), compared to the generalist corpus (n=80, *Social Problems* and *Social Forces*).

## When to Apply This Profile

Apply when the target venue or subfield is social movement studies — *Mobilization*, *Social Movement Studies*, *Research in Social Movements*, SMS-oriented special issues, or any article whose primary contribution is to social movement theory.

## Same Toolkit, Different Settings

Social movements theory sections use the same arc structures, paragraph functions, and turn moves as generalist sociology. The differences are distributional: which arcs and turns get used most often, and how case material relates to theory. No fundamentally novel argument structure appears — but the mix is distinctive enough that generalist defaults would steer authors wrong on arc selection and theory-case organization.

**A note on measurement**: These findings derive from qualitative coding of argument style (arc structure, turn type, theory-case integration) rather than word counts or citation statistics. Quantitative extraction of theory sections across corpora is sensitive to different markdown formats, heading conventions, and boundary definitions — we focus on what's robust to those artifacts.

## How Social Movements Differs from Generalist

Four key differences in argument style:

| Finding | Generalist | Social Movements | Implication |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| 1. Building-blocks is the dominant arc | Mixed (Funnel common) | **Building-blocks 52%** | Assemble concepts sequentially; don't default to funnel |
| 2. Dialogue arcs are absent | Available | **0% in sample** | Don't stage Position A vs Position B in the theory section — that framing belongs in the introduction |
| 3. Case material weaves into theory | Theory section is "pure theory" | **32% weave case into theory** | Integrating case context throughout theory is legitimate, not a sign of poor organization |
| 4. Limitation-critique turns are common | Gap statements dominate | **24% use limitation critique** | "This framework can't account for..." is a recognized pivot, not just gap-filling |

**Root pattern**: SM theory sections build theoretical architectures by assembling concepts one by one (building-blocks), often illustrating them with case material as they go. They arrive at the contribution through gap identification or by critiquing existing frameworks. The back-and-forth dialogue arc — which the generalist skill recognizes — simply doesn't appear in SM venues.

## Adjusted Guidance

### Arc Structure (Social Movements)

| Arc | Generalist | Social Movements | When to use |
|-----|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| Building-blocks | Available | **52% (dominant)** | Default choice. Concept A → Concept B → Concept C → synthesis. Natural for SM's multi-concept theoretical traditions. |
| Problem-response | Available | **28%** | When existing approaches demonstrably fail. Common in Moby (40%) for paradigm-critique contributions. |
| Funnel | Common default | **20%** | Broad context → narrowing. Still appropriate for gap-filler contributions, but not the default. |
| Dialogue | Available | **0%** | Do not use for SM theory sections. If the contribution involves adjudicating a debate, frame the debate in the introduction and use building-blocks or problem-response in the theory section. |

### Theory-Case Integration (Social Movements)

This is the most distinctive SM feature. Generalist theory sections typically keep case/empirical material separate — the theory section is "pure theory," and case details appear in methods. SM theory sections often integrate case material throughout.

| Pattern | Social Movements % | Description | When to use |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Theory-first | **36%** | Pure theory precedes any case mention | Default for quantitative articles and pure theoretical contributions |
| Woven | **32%** | Case details appear throughout theory discussion | When the case illuminates theoretical points ("The Egyptian revolution illustrates...") |
| Separate | **24%** | Distinct "background" and "theory" subsections | When extensive case context is needed but shouldn't interrupt theoretical flow |
| Case-first | **8%** | Case background precedes theory | Rare; use only when the case is the puzzle and theory follows from it |

**Practical implication**: If your article's case naturally illustrates theoretical points, weave it in — don't artificially separate theory from case just because generalist conventions expect it. But if weaving, ensure each case reference *advances the theoretical argument* rather than just providing background.

### The Turn (Social Movements)

| Turn type | Social Movements % | Description | Signature phrase |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Gap statement | **40%** | Identifies what's missing | "What remains unclear is..." / "Few studies have examined..." |
| Extension claim | **28%** | Extends existing framework | "We extend X by..." / "This framework can be applied to..." |
| Limitation critique | **24%** | Challenges existing approach | "This framework cannot account for..." / "The dominant approach overlooks..." |
| Integration promise | **4%** | Brings traditions together | "By bringing X and Y into conversation..." |

**Venue note**: Limitation-critique turns are more common in *Mobilization* (33%) than in *Social Movement Studies* (10%), consistent with Moby's paradigm-critique orientation. If targeting *Mobilization*, a limitation-critique turn is a strong choice for theory-extension and concept-building contributions.

### Dominant Mode (Social Movements)

| Mode | Social Movements % | What the theory section is primarily doing |
|------|-------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Hypothesis derivation | **32%** | Building to testable predictions (quant articles) |
| Literature review | **20%** | Surveying what's known |
| Conceptual development | **20%** | Building new concepts or typologies |
| Framework application | **20%** | Explaining a theory to be applied |
| Debate mapping | **8%** | Laying out competing positions |

Hypothesis derivation correlates with quantitative method — 40% of articles include numbered hypotheses (H1, H2...), all in quantitative studies. Qualitative SM articles never use formal hypotheses.

### Hypotheses (Social Movements)

| | Social Movements % | Notes |
|---|-------------------|-------|
| Numbered hypotheses (H1, H2...) | **40%** | All quantitative articles; common in both Moby and SMS |
| No formal hypotheses | **60%** | All qualitative/theoretical articles |

**Practical implication**: If your article is quantitative, the theory section should build toward numbered hypotheses — this is expected. If qualitative, state expectations informally or not at all; formal hypotheses in a qualitative SM article would read as genre confusion.

## Cluster Interactions

The contribution-type clusters (Gap-Filler, Theory-Extender, etc.) still apply. Here's how they interact with SM-specific patterns:

| Contribution cluster | Recommended SM arc | Likely turn type | Theory-case pattern |
|---------------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Gap-Filler | Funnel or Building-blocks | Gap statement | Separate or Theory-first |
| Theory-Extender | Building-blocks | Extension claim or Limitation critique | Theory-first |
| Concept-Builder | Building-blocks or Problem-response | Limitation critique | Woven (case illustrates concepts) |
| Synthesis Integrator | Building-blocks | Integration promise or Gap statement | Theory-first |
| Problem-Driven | Problem-response | Gap statement or Limitation critique | Woven or Case-first |

## Writing Checklist

### Before Finalizing a Social Movements Theory Section

Verify:

- [ ] **Arc structure**: Is the arc appropriate? Building-blocks is the SM default (52%). Do NOT use Dialogue — stage debates in the introduction, not here.
- [ ] **Theory-case integration**: If case material appears in the theory section, does each reference advance the theoretical argument (not just provide background)?
- [ ] **The turn**: Is the gap/contribution pivot specific? SM readers expect theoretical precision — "more research is needed" is insufficient.
- [ ] **Turn type**: Does the turn match the contribution? Limitation-critique turns are strong for Moby; gap statements work everywhere.
- [ ] **Hypotheses**: If quantitative, are hypotheses numbered and derived from theory? If qualitative, are formal hypotheses absent?
- [ ] **Audience calibration**: Does the theory section assume SMS specialist knowledge? Don't explain basic concepts (frames, repertoires, political opportunity).
- [ ] **Subsection headings**: Are headings substantive (topic-based) rather than generic ("Literature Review")? SM theory sections use substantive labels.
