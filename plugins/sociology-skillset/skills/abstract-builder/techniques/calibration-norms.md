# Calibration Norms

Statistical benchmarks from analysis of 193 abstracts from *Social Problems*, *Social Forces* (n=91), *American Sociological Review* (n=69), and *American Journal of Sociology* (n=33). Use these norms to calibrate your abstract against venue expectations.

## Overall Benchmarks by Venue

| Metric | SP/SF | ASR | AJS |
|--------|-------|-----|-----|
| **Word count (median)** | 189 | 196 | 157 |
| **Word count (IQR)** | 166–201 | 183–208 | 149–170 |
| **Word count (range)** | 116–250 | 131–295 | 104–186 |
| **Sentence count (median)** | 6 | 7 | 5 |

| **Words per sentence** | ~29 | ~28 | ~31 |

---

## Target Ranges by Venue

Use the interquartile range (IQR) as your target. Deviations should be intentional.

### Word Count
| Venue | Target (IQR) | Median | Red Flags |
|-------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| **SP/SF** | 166–201 | 189 | Under 165 or over 210 |
| **ASR** | 183–208 | 196 | Under 180 or over 220 |
| **AJS** | 149–170 | 157 | Under 140 or over 180 |

### Sentence Count
| Venue | Target (IQR) | Median | Red Flags |
|-------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| **SP/SF** | 5–7 | 6 | Under 5 or over 8 |
| **ASR** | 6–8 | 7 | Under 5 or over 9 |
| **AJS** | 5–6 | 5 | Under 4 or over 7 |

### Words per Sentence
- **Target**: ~28–31 words per sentence (consistent across venues)
- **Under 25 words**: May feel choppy
- **Over 35 words**: May need splitting

## Archetype-Specific Norms (SP/SF baseline)

### Empirical-Showcase (SP/SF 39%; ASR 15%; AJS 12%)

| Metric | Value | Range |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Word count (median) | 189 | 139-248 |
| Sentence count (median) | 6.5 | 5-9 |
| Words per sentence | 29.1 | -- |

**Key**: Standard length. Phenomenon-led opening. 2-4 findings sentences. Less common at ASR/AJS — use when the phenomenon is genuinely compelling.

---

### Research-Report (SP/SF 43%; ASR 71%; AJS 79%)

| Metric | Value | Range |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Word count (median) | 183 | 116-250 |
| Sentence count (median) | 6.4 | 4-10 |
| Words per sentence | 28.6 | -- |

**Key**: Most flexible range. **Default archetype at ASR/AJS.** Can be very compact (116 words at SP/SF, 104 words at AJS) or extended (250 words at SP/SF, 295 at ASR).

---

### Stakes-Driven (SP/SF 13%; ASR 3%; AJS 3%)

| Metric | Value | Range |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Word count (median) | 196 | 155-248 |
| Sentence count (median) | 7.0 | 5-10 |
| Words per sentence | 28.0 | -- |

**Key**: Longest archetype. Needs space for stakes + gap + implications. **Near-absent at ASR/AJS** — these journals prefer scholarly framing over urgency appeals.

---

### Puzzle-Solver (SP/SF 6%; ASR 6%; AJS 3%)

| Metric | Value | Range |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Word count (median) | 185 | 139-238 |
| Sentence count (median) | 6.6 | 4-10 |
| Words per sentence | 28.0 | -- |

**Key**: Standard length. Quick transition from question to data. Viable at all venues but always uncommon.

## Content Benchmarks

### Theory Mention
| Venue | Rate | Guidance |
|-------|------|----------|
| SP/SF | 17% | Optional, not expected |
| ASR | 73% | **Expected** — signal theoretical contribution |
| AJS | 67% | **Expected** — signal theoretical contribution |

- **If included**: Brief (1-2 phrases, not extended exposition)
- **At ASR**: Naming a novel concept is very common (>40% introduce a named term like "selective empathy," "portfolio routing," "cultural tariffing")

### Sample Size Mention
- **Rate**: ~24% explicitly state sample size (N); ~88% describe data source
- **Guidance**: Including N is helpful but not universal
- **Format**: "Drawing on [N] interviews with..."

### First-Person Usage
| Venue | Rate | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| SP/SF | 62% | "We find" / "I argue" is common |
| ASR | 35% | Acceptable but not the norm |
| AJS | 24% | Less common; "The authors" occasionally used |

- **Forms**: "We find that...", "I argue that...", "Our results..."
- **Alternative**: "This study finds...", "Findings show..."

## Move Distribution

### Essential Moves (include in every abstract)

| Move | Frequency | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| STUDY-FOCUS | 90% | What study examines |
| DATA-DESCRIBE | 87% | Interview sample |
| FINDINGS | 95% | 2-3 sentences typically |
| CLOSING | 100% | Contribution or implications |

### Optional Moves

| Move | Frequency | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| GAP | ~40% | Common in Research-Report, Stakes-Driven |
| PRIOR-RESEARCH | ~30% | If not opening move |
| ARGUMENT | ~11% | Strong theoretical contribution |

---

## Closing Move Distribution

| Closing Type | SP/SF | ASR | AJS |
|--------------|-------|-----|-----|
| CLOSE-CONTRIBUTION | 72.5% | 53.6% | 42.4% |
| CLOSE-IMPLICATIONS | 16.5% | 18.8% | 18.2% |
| CLOSE-FINDINGS | 9.9% | 26.1% | 39.4% |
| CLOSE-GENERALIZATION | 1.1% | 1.4% | 0% |

**Guidance**: Default to CLOSE-CONTRIBUTION at SP/SF. At ASR, contribution still leads but findings closings are common (26%). At AJS, contribution and findings closings are nearly equal — closing on a strong finding is fully acceptable when word count is tight.

---

## Opening Move Distribution

| Opening Type | SP/SF | ASR | AJS | Archetype |
|--------------|-------|-----|-----|-----------|
| OPEN-PHENOMENON | 38.5% | 34.8% | 15.2% | Empirical-Showcase |
| PRIOR-RESEARCH | ~25% | 26.1% | 36.4% | Research-Report |
| OPEN-RESEARCH | ~18% | 27.5% | 39.4% | Research-Report |
| OPEN-STAKES | 13.2% | 2.9% | 3.0% | Stakes-Driven |
| OPEN-PUZZLE | 5.5% | 4.3% | 3.0% | Puzzle-Solver |

**Venue note**: AJS strongly favors OPEN-RESEARCH and PRIOR-RESEARCH (76% combined) over phenomenon openings. ASR has a more balanced three-way split between phenomenon, prior-research, and open-research. Stakes openings are nearly absent at both ASR and AJS.

## Interpreting Deviations

| Deviation | Possible Reason | Action |
|-----------|-----------------|--------|
| **Under word count floor** | Underdeveloped findings | Expand findings preview |
| **Over word count ceiling** | Over-elaboration | Cut secondary details |
| **Under sentence count floor** | Missing essential moves | Add STUDY-FOCUS, DATA, or FINDINGS |
| **Over sentence count ceiling** | Too detailed | Combine or cut sentences |
| **No closing claim** | Abstract trails off | Add CLOSE-CONTRIBUTION (or CLOSE-FINDINGS at AJS) |
| **Weak findings** | Only 1 sentence | Expand to 2-3 sentences |
| **No theory mention at ASR/AJS** | Missing expected signal | Add brief theoretical positioning |

## Journal-Specific Notes

| Journal | Typical Range | Median | Archetype Default | Key Notes |
|---------|---------------|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| Social Problems | 150–250 words | ~189 | Balanced mix | Prefers informative abstracts |
| Social Forces | 150–250 words | ~189 | Balanced mix | Allows structured or unstructured |
| ASR | 131–295 words | 196 | Research-Report (71%) | Theory mention expected (73%); novel concept naming very common |
| AJS | 104–186 words | 157 | Research-Report (79%) | Extremely concise; open with research/prior-research; findings closings acceptable (39%) |

**Guidance by venue**:
- **SP/SF**: Target 180–200 words
- **ASR**: Target 180–220 words; name your concept if you have one
- **AJS**: Target 140–170 words; every word must earn its place

---

## Quick Reference

### SP/SF Target
- **Words**: 180–200
- **Sentences**: 6
- **Structure**: Opening -> Study Focus -> Data -> Findings (2-3) -> Contribution
- **Closing**: CONTRIBUTION with strong verb

### ASR Target
- **Words**: 180–220
- **Sentences**: 7
- **Structure**: Opening -> Study Focus -> Data -> Findings (2-3) -> Contribution
- **Closing**: CONTRIBUTION (54%) or FINDINGS (26%)
- **Theory mention**: Expected; name novel concepts

### AJS Target
- **Words**: 140–170
- **Sentences**: 5
- **Structure**: Opening -> Study Focus -> Data -> Findings (2) -> Contribution/Findings

### Red Flags (all venues)
- Under venue word count floor (underdeveloped)
- Over venue word count ceiling (over-elaborated)
- Under 4 sentences (missing moves)
- Over 9 sentences (too detailed)
- No explicit contribution or findings claim at closing
