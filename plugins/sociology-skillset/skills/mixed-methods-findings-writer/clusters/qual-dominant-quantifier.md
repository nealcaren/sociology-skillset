# Qual-Dominant Quantifier

5/84 articles (6%). Qualitative evidence -- interviews, ethnographic field notes, archival documents -- drives the analysis. Quantitative evidence is limited to descriptive statistics (frequencies, percentages, cross-tabulations) that contextualize or quantify the scope of qualitative patterns. No regression models or formal causal inference.

## Defining Feature

This cluster reads like a qualitative findings section that strategically deploys descriptive numbers to establish prevalence, scope, or distribution. The qualitative evidence does all the analytical heavy lifting: interpreting meaning, tracing processes, developing concepts. Quantitative evidence answers "how many" and "how widespread" but not "what effect" or "how much." The integration is asymmetric by design.

## Canonical Arc

```
QUALITATIVE-VIGNETTE → THEMATIC (theme 1) → ILLUSTRATE →
THEMATIC (theme 2) → ILLUSTRATE → BASELINE →
THEMATIC (theme 3) → ILLUSTRATE → COMPARISON
```

The BASELINE move typically appears mid-section to anchor qualitative themes in descriptive statistics ("Of the 42 organizations in our sample, 28 (67%) exhibited this pattern"). The QUALITATIVE-VIGNETTE opening is a defining feature of this cluster.

## Paragraph Budget

| THEMATIC (theme 1) | 5-8 | 25% | Qual |
| ILLUSTRATE | 2-4 | 10% | Qual |
| THEMATIC (theme 2) | 5-8 | 25% | Qual |

Total: 21-37 paragraphs typical. Qualitative evidence: 85-90% of space. Quantitative evidence: 10-15%.

## Opening Move

**Qualitative vignette** (100% in this cluster).

Pattern:
> On a Tuesday morning in March 2019, I arrived at the community center to find [detailed scene-setting]. Elena, the director, was [action]. "We've been doing this for twelve years," she told me, gesturing toward [context]. "Every year it gets harder." This opening scene introduces the central tension that emerged across our [N] cases: [generalize to main finding].

The vignette opening serves three functions: (1) establishes the qualitative evidence as primary, (2) signals the ethnographic or interview-based methodology, and (3) introduces the central theme or tension that the section will develop.

## Closing Move

**Qualitative synthesis** (dominant).

Pattern:
> Across the three themes presented above, a coherent pattern emerges. Respondents navigated [phenomenon] by [process], a strategy that [outcome]. The descriptive statistics confirm the scope of this pattern: [X]% of cases exhibited the central dynamic. But the qualitative evidence reveals what these numbers cannot: that [deeper insight about meaning, process, or experience]. As Rosa summarized near the end of our interview: "[closing quotation]."

## Signature Techniques

1. **Extended quotation as primary evidence**: Block quotations (50-150 words) are the evidentiary backbone. Each thematic subsection includes 3-5 substantial quotations, each followed by 2-4 sentences of analytical interpretation. Quotations are not decorative; they carry the argument.

2. **Vignette-then-generalize**: Open with a detailed case, then show it is typical. "Elena's experience was not unique. Among the 34 respondents who discussed [topic], 26 described a similar pattern."

3. **Descriptive quantification within qualitative themes**: Embed counts and percentages in qualitative paragraphs. "Nearly two-thirds of respondents (22 of 34) described [pattern], while the remaining third reported [alternative]." This technique anchors qualitative claims in countable evidence.

4. **Process-tracing across informants**: Reconstruct a process or sequence by drawing on multiple informants' accounts. "The process typically began with [step 1, described by Informant A]. This was followed by [step 2, described by Informant B]. The culmination, as [Informant C] explained, was [step 3]."

5. **Cross-case comparison**: Explicitly compare informants or sites that differ on key dimensions. "While the urban organizations (N = 18) approached [issue] through [strategy], the rural organizations (N = 16) relied on [alternative strategy]. This divergence reflects [theoretical interpretation]."

## Method Integration Pattern

**Illustration** and **complementarity**. Quantitative evidence illustrates the scope or distribution of qualitative patterns; qualitative evidence provides the substance. The integration is asymmetric: qualitative evidence could stand alone; quantitative evidence could not. The descriptive statistics serve a legitimation function in mixed-methods journals, demonstrating systematic analysis across cases rather than cherry-picked examples.

## Theory Linking Density

**Heavy.** Comparable to the Thematic Integrator. Because the evidence is primarily qualitative, interpretation is continuous and densely theoretical. Each theme is framed by theory, quotations are interpreted through theoretical lenses, and cross-case comparisons are driven by theoretical categories.

## Table/Figure Strategy

**Narrative-driven** (primary). The section is organized around prose and quotations, not tables. A common pattern: one table early on showing case characteristics or coding frequencies, referenced occasionally. Figures are rare. If present, they show distributions or typologies rather than regression results.

## Subsection Structure

**By theme** (universal). Headings name substantive themes or concepts, often drawn from the theoretical framework or from in-vivo codes:
- "Making Do: Resource Scarcity and Organizational Adaptation"
- "'We Had No Choice': Constrained Agency in Institutional Settings"
- "Resistance Through Ritual"

The number of themes is typically 3-4, allowing deep engagement with each.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Under-quantification**: Failing to provide any counts, percentages, or distributional information. Even in a qual-dominant paper, readers in mixed-methods journals expect some systematic evidence of prevalence.
- **Over-quotation, under-analysis**: Stringing together quotations without adequate analytical interpretation between them. The ratio should be roughly 1:1 -- every substantial quotation gets at least 2 sentences of interpretation.
- **Anecdotal impression**: Relying on a single informant to establish a pattern. Show that the pattern appears across multiple cases before developing it in depth through one case.
- **Missing the "mixed" in mixed-methods**: If descriptive statistics are confined to a single paragraph and never referenced again, the paper reads as purely qualitative. Weave numbers into thematic paragraphs.
- **Flat thematic structure**: Themes presented as equal and unrelated rather than as building toward a cumulative argument. The order of themes should be analytically motivated.
