# Alternating Validator

8/84 articles (10%). Methods alternate in regular cycles throughout the section; each type validates, triangulates, or extends the findings from the other. Distinguished from the Thematic Integrator by its explicit back-and-forth rhythm rather than within-paragraph weaving.

## Defining Feature

The section oscillates between quantitative and qualitative evidence in a deliberate pattern: a quantitative finding is presented, then qualitative evidence confirms or complicates it, then the next quantitative finding appears, followed by its qualitative counterpart. The rhetorical function is triangulation -- showing that the same conclusion is reached through independent methods. The alternation is visible at the paragraph or subsection level.

## Canonical Arc

```
DESCRIBE → BASELINE → ILLUSTRATE → VISUAL → THEMATIC →
ILLUSTRATE → COMPARISON → BASELINE → ILLUSTRATE → MECHANISM
```

The key structural feature is the repeated BASELINE/THEMATIC → ILLUSTRATE cycle. Each quantitative claim gets a qualitative response (or vice versa) before the section advances.

## Paragraph Budget

| Move | Paragraphs | Share | Method |
|------|-----------|-------|--------|
| DESCRIBE | 1-2 | 5% | Quant |
| BASELINE (cycle 1) | 2-3 | 15% | Quant |
| ILLUSTRATE (cycle 1) | 2-3 | 15% | Qual |
| VISUAL | 1-2 | 5% | Quant |
| THEMATIC / BASELINE (cycle 2) | 2-3 | 15% | Mixed |
| ILLUSTRATE (cycle 2) | 2-3 | 15% | Qual |
| COMPARISON | 2-3 | 15% | Mixed |
| MECHANISM | 1-2 | 10% | Mixed |
| SUMMARY | 1 | 5% | Mixed |

Total: 14-22 paragraphs typical. The cycle count varies: 2-4 full quant-qual cycles is the norm.

## Opening Move

**Table reference** or **visual** (75% combined).

Table reference pattern:
> Table 1 presents descriptive statistics from the survey data. Before examining these patterns in the regression models, we note that [key descriptive finding], a pattern that our interview respondents corroborated.

Visual pattern:
> Figure 1 displays the distribution of [outcome] across [groups]. The divergence is striking: [describe pattern]. In the following sections, we examine this pattern using both regression models and in-depth interviews, alternating between the two data sources.

## Closing Move

Variable across the cluster. Options include mechanism test, integration summary, or qualitative synthesis. The most common pattern ends with a MECHANISM move that draws on both data sources.

Mechanism closing pattern:
> Both the statistical mediation analysis and the interview evidence converge on the same mechanism. The regression-based indirect effect through [mediator] is significant (b = .12, 95% CI [.04, .22]), and respondents consistently described [mediator] as the primary channel through which [X] affected [Y]. As one respondent summarized: "[quotation]."

## Signature Techniques

1. **Triangulation claim**: Explicitly state that the two methods reach the same conclusion. "The regression results and interview data converge: [finding]. The quantitative evidence establishes the pattern's magnitude, while the qualitative evidence confirms its experiential reality."

2. **Method-specific transition sentences**: Brief sentences marking the switch. "Turning to the interview data..." / "Returning to the regression models..." / "The survey data confirm this qualitative pattern."

3. **Parallel structure across methods**: Present quant and qual findings using structurally parallel language. "Survey respondents in the top quartile reported X (mean = Y). Interview participants in similar positions described [parallel finding using their words]."

4. **Cross-case comparison**: Compare cases or informants along the same dimension measured quantitatively. If the regression shows that [group A] differs from [group B], present interview data from members of both groups.

5. **Visual-qualitative pairing**: Present a figure showing a quantitative pattern, then immediately follow with qualitative evidence that explains or humanizes the pattern. "Figure 2 shows the sharp increase after 2015. Respondents who lived through this period described..."

## Method Integration Pattern

**Triangulation** and **complementarity**. The alternating structure serves a validation function: if both methods converge, the finding is robust. But the best articles also use the alternation for complementarity, with each method adding a dimension the other cannot address.

## Theory Linking Density

**Moderate to heavy.** Theory appears at the beginning of each cycle (framing the expectation) and at the end (interpreting convergence or divergence). The triangulation structure itself serves a theoretical function: convergence from independent methods strengthens theoretical claims.

## Table/Figure Strategy

**Figure-driven** or **hybrid**. Figures play a larger role in this cluster than any other because they serve as visual anchors for the quant-qual alternation. A figure presents the quantitative pattern; the following paragraphs provide qualitative elaboration. Tables tend to be referenced in passing rather than walked through cell by cell.

## Subsection Structure

Varies. Two main patterns:
1. **By finding**: each subsection addresses one finding, with quant and qual alternating within it
2. **By cycle**: sections explicitly labeled "Quantitative Evidence for [X]" followed by "Qualitative Evidence for [X]"

Pattern 1 is more common and reads more fluidly.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Mechanical alternation**: Rigid quant-then-qual-then-quant without allowing the evidence to determine the natural rhythm. Some findings need more quantitative depth; others need more qualitative depth. The alternation should serve the argument, not a formula.
- **Superficial triangulation**: Claiming convergence when the quant and qual evidence address slightly different questions. Be precise about what exactly is being triangulated.
- **Repetitive transitions**: Using the same transition phrase ("Turning to the interview data...") every cycle. Vary the method-switching language.
- **Equal-time fallacy**: Giving exactly equal space to quant and qual for every finding. The proportion should reflect which method is more informative for that particular claim.
- **Missing divergence**: When quant and qual evidence do not converge, this is analytically interesting -- do not suppress it. Explain the divergence. Divergence can reveal boundary conditions, countervailing processes, or measurement limitations. Treat it as an analytical opportunity, not an embarrassment. Use the cross-method divergence acknowledgment technique (see `references/techniques.md`).
