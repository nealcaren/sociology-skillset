# Field Profile: Social Movement Studies (SMS)

This field profile adjusts article-bookends guidance for articles targeting social movement studies venues. Based on genre analysis of 39 SMS articles.

## When to Apply This Profile

Apply when the target venue or subfield is social movement studies. Common venues:

- *Mobilization*
- *Social Movement Studies*
- *Research in Social Movements, Conflicts and Change*
- Social movements special issues in general journals
- Any article whose primary contribution is to social movement theory

Also apply when the article's core topic involves protest, collective action, contentious politics, activism, or social movements — even if targeting a generalist journal — as SMS conventions shape reader expectations.

## How SMS Differs from Generalist Sociology

Eight key findings from comparing SMS introductions (n=39) to the generalist corpus (n=80, *Social Problems* and *Social Forces*):

| Finding | Generalist | SMS | Implication |
|---------|-----------|-----|-------------|
| 1. Introductions are shorter | 761 words, 6 ¶ | 600 words, 4 ¶ | Get to the point faster |
| 2. Theory-led openings 3.4× more common | 6% | 20.5% | Framework is a legitimate first move |
| 3. 74% use SMS-specific structural patterns | 0% | 74.4% | Three patterns not seen in generalist work |
| 4. Stakes-led openings nearly absent | 11% | 2.6% | Audience is pre-committed; don't sell importance |
| 5. Roadmaps are more common | 40% | 69.2% | Theoretical complexity demands signposting |
| 6. Citations appear earlier | Middle of intro | 76.9% cite in ¶1 | Position within scholarly debate immediately |
| 7. Theoretical gaps dominate | Mixed | 46.2% theoretical | "New case" is insufficient; show theoretical stakes |
| 8. Audience assumes shared vocabulary | General public framing | Specialist framing | Don't explain basic SMS concepts |

**Root pattern**: SMS writes for specialists who share vocabulary, care about internal debates, and need studies located within protest cycles rather than justified from first principles.

## Adjusted Benchmarks

### Introduction Benchmarks (SMS)

| Feature | Generalist Default | SMS Adjusted | Notes |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|-------|
| Word count | 600–950 | **340–850** | 21% shorter median |
| Paragraphs | 4–8 | **3–5** | More compact |
| Opening move | Phenomenon-led (74%) | Phenomenon-led (48.7%), Theory-led (20.5%), Case-led (12.8%) | Much more theory-led |
| Data mention | Middle of section | **79.5% mention data; 15% in ¶1** | Earlier data preview |
| Roadmap | Present in 40% | **Present in 69%** | Nearly twice as common |
| First citation | Middle paragraphs | **77% cite in ¶1** | Immediate scholarly positioning |
| Gap type | Mixed | **Theoretical (46%), Empirical (36%)** | Theory-first justification |

### Conclusion/Discussion Benchmarks (SMS)

Based on genre analysis of 39 SMS articles, SMS conclusion/discussion sections differ substantially from generalist sociology. Seven key findings:

| Finding | Generalist | SMS | Implication |
|---------|-----------|-----|-------------|
| 1. Conclusion-only is the default | Combined D+C common | **~65% use "Conclusion" only** | Discussion work gets embedded in findings sections; don't force a separate Discussion unless needed |
| 2. Wider word count range | 300–500 (standalone conclusion) | **350–900** | SMS conclusions do more work than generalist ones because they often absorb discussion functions |
| 3. Limitations rarely present | 69% | **~20%** | Don't waste space on limitations; SMS readers assume methodological constraints |
| 4. Opening move is summary, not restatement | Restatement (71%) | **Summary-of-findings (~60%)** | Open by summarizing what you found, not restating the puzzle |
| 5. Callbacks less formal | 100% required | **~85% via vocabulary echo** | Return to key theoretical terms from introduction; formal callbacks less expected |
| 6. Coda is field-reflexive | Resonant closing image | **Field-reflexive (~35%)** | End by positioning findings within SMS debates, not with a vivid image |
| 7. Citation density highly variable | Low | **0–30, median ~8** | Theory-heavy conclusions cite more; empirical case conclusions cite less |

**Root pattern**: SMS conclusions emphasize theoretical positioning and field-level implications over policy stakes, individual resonance, or methodological caution.

| Feature | Generalist Default | SMS Adjusted | Notes |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|-------|
| Section structure | Combined D+C common | **Conclusion-only (~65%)** | Separate Discussion sections appear in ~20% of articles |
| Word count (standalone conclusion) | 300–500 | **350–900** | Median ~600; longer when absorbing discussion functions |
| Word count (with separate Discussion) | 900–1,450 combined | **Discussion 400–1,200 + Conclusion 300–600** | Discussion sections when present tend to be citation-heavy |
| Paragraphs | 2–4 | **3–6** | More paragraphs than generalist standalone conclusions |
| Opening move | Restatement (71%) | **Summary-of-findings (60%), Theoretical-framing (20%), Contribution-claim (12%)** | Restatement is rare; go straight to findings |
| Limitations | Present in 69% | **Present in ~20%** | Include only if methodological constraints genuinely matter for interpretation |
| Future directions | Present in 76% | **Present in ~65%** | Similar to generalist; common and expected |
| Policy implications | Common in problem-driven | **Present in ~25%** | SMS conclusions focus on theoretical implications over policy |
| Callback to intro | **Required (100%)** | **Present in ~85%, via vocabulary echo** | Echo key theoretical terms; formal "we began by" callbacks optional |
| Coda type | Resonant closing sentence | **Field-reflexive (35%), Resonant-statement (30%), Future-vision (25%)** | End with a statement about what the field should attend to |
| Citation density | Low (0–4) | **Variable: 0–30, median ~8** | Citations cluster when engaging theoretical debates in conclusion |

### SMS Conclusion Opening Moves

| Opening Move | SMS % | Description |
|-------------|-------|-------------|
| Summary-of-findings | ~60% | "This study examined... We found..." |
| Theoretical-framing | ~20% | "The [concept] we proposed illuminates..." |
| Contribution-claim | ~12% | "This article contributes to [debate] by showing..." |
| Puzzle-restatement | ~5% | "We began by asking how... The answer lies in..." |
| Other | ~3% | Quote-led, narrative return |

### SMS Conclusion Coda Types

| Coda Type | SMS % | Description | Example Logic |
|-----------|-------|-------------|---------------|
| Field-reflexive | ~35% | Positions findings within SMS debates and research agenda | "Scholars of [topic] will need to attend more carefully to [mechanism]" |
| Resonant-statement | ~30% | Declarative sentence crystallizing the contribution | "What appears as [X] is better understood as [Y]" |
| Future-vision | ~25% | Projects forward to what comes next for the movement or research area | "Whether [trend] will [outcome] remains an open question" |
| Policy-call | ~5% | Draws out practical implications | Rare in SMS; use only when policy stakes are central |
| Quote | ~5% | Participant or movement voice | Effective but unusual in SMS conclusions |

## Opening Move Distribution

| Opening Move | Generalist | SMS | Δ |
|-------------|-----------|-----|---|
| Phenomenon-led | 74% | 48.7% | −25 pp |
| Theory-led | 6% | **20.5%** | +15 pp |
| Case-led | 8% | 12.8% | +5 pp |
| Question-led | 1% | 7.7% | +7 pp |
| Quote-led | 0% | 5.1% | +5 pp |
| Stakes-led | 11% | **2.6%** | −8 pp |

**Key shifts**: Theory-led moves become a primary option, not a niche choice. Stakes-led moves nearly vanish — SMS audiences don't need convincing the topic matters.

## SMS-Specific Structural Patterns

Three structural patterns appear in 74% of SMS introductions. These are not seen in the generalist corpus.

### 1. Movement-Wave Survey (30.8%, n=12)

Opens by naming a broad phenomenon — a protest wave, an era of mobilization, a cross-national trend — then surveys multiple instances or cases to establish the landscape before narrowing to the specific study.

**Function**: Cycle-location work. Places the study within a broader wave of contention. Tells the reader: "Here is the wave; here is where my case fits."

**Signature moves**:
- Name a protest cycle or wave
- List multiple movement events, countries, or episodes
- Establish the panoramic scope before narrowing
- Data mention early (92%)

**Benchmarks**:
| Feature | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Median words | 750 |
| Median paragraphs | 4–5 |
| Modal opening | Phenomenon-led (83%) |
| Citations (median) | 10 |
| Roadmap | 75% |
| Gap type | Mixed (empirical 50%, theoretical 42%) |

**When to use**: When the study examines a case that is part of a larger protest wave or cycle, and the reader needs to see the panoramic context to understand why the specific case matters.

**Example opening logic**: "The [wave/cycle/era] saw mobilizations across [countries/contexts]. In [Country A], protesters [X]; in [Country B], [Y]. Yet [gap in understanding this wave]. This article examines [specific case] to [contribution]."

### 2. Field-Reflexive Pivot (25.6%, n=10)

Opens with meta-commentary on SMS as a field — what it has studied, what it has missed, where it should go — then diagnoses a limitation or blind spot.

**Function**: Scholarly intervention. Signals: "Here is how our field has been thinking about X, and here is what's wrong with that."

**Signature moves**:
- Open by addressing SMS's own theoretical debates
- Cite immediately (90% cite in ¶1)
- Diagnose a field-level limitation
- Low data preview (only 50% mention data in intro)
- Theoretical gap is dominant (80%)

**Benchmarks**:
| Feature | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Median words | 625 |
| Median paragraphs | 4 |
| Modal opening | Theory-led (50%) |
| Citations (median) | 12 |
| Roadmap | 80% |
| Gap type | Theoretical (80%) |

**When to use**: When the contribution is primarily theoretical — offering a new framework, correcting a conceptual blind spot, or bridging literatures within SMS.

**Example opening logic**: "[SMS concept/tradition] has been central to how scholars understand [phenomenon]. Yet this framework [limitation]. We propose [alternative/extension] that [contribution]."

### 3. Protest-Event Anchor (17.9%, n=7)

Anchors the introduction in a specific mobilization event — a particular protest, uprising, or contentious episode — with journalistic-style narrative detail.

**Function**: Case-grounding. Uses a concrete event as the introduction's gravitational center. Assumes reader interest in movement details.

**Signature moves**:
- Open with a specific event (date, place, actors)
- Delayed citation — only 14% cite in ¶1; 43% have zero citations in intro
- Vivid, narrative-style prose
- Data always mentioned (100%)
- Highest roadmap rate (86%)
- Low median citations (2) — but bimodal: either very few (0–2) or substantial (15–20)

**Benchmarks**:
| Feature | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Median words | 426 |
| Median paragraphs | 4 |
| Modal opening | Case-led (57%) |
| Citations (median) | 2 |
| Roadmap | 86% |
| Gap type | Empirical (57%), Theoretical (43%) |

**When to use**: When a specific mobilization event is the case under study, and the event's concrete details create a compelling entry point. Works best when the event is well-known to SMS readers.

**Example opening logic**: "On [date], [actors] [specific action] in [location]. [What happened]. [Why it mattered]. This article draws on [data] to examine [question about this event]."

## SMS Introduction Clusters

Five empirically derived clusters describe distinct introduction strategies in SMS. These interact with — but don't replace — the contribution-type clusters (Gap-Filler, Theory-Extension, etc.).

### Cross-Cluster Summary

| Cluster | n (%) | Words | ¶ | Citations | Roadmap | SMS Pattern | Modal Opening |
|---------|-------|-------|---|-----------|---------|-------------|---------------|
| C1: Movement-Wave Panorama | 12 (31%) | 750 | 4–5 | 10 | 75% | movement-wave-survey | phenomenon-led |
| C2: Theory-Driven Field Critique | 10 (26%) | 625 | 4 | 12 | 80% | field-reflexive | theory-led |
| C3: Event-Anchored Narrative | 7 (18%) | 426 | 4 | 2 | 86% | protest-event-anchor | case-led |
| C4: Compact Phenomenon Dispatch | 7 (18%) | 329 | 3 | 8 | 71% | none | phenomenon-led |
| C5: Dense Phenomenon Mapping | 3 (8%) | 850 | 5 | 24 | 0% | none | phenomenon-led |

### C1: Movement-Wave Panorama (31%)

The most common SMS strategy. Opens by naming a broad phenomenon then surveys multiple instances. Distinctive for its *cycle-location work*. Gap type is heterogeneous: half empirical, half theoretical. Resembles a wide-angle lens that gradually zooms in.

**Best interaction with contribution types**: Gap-Filler (empirical cases within waves), Synthesis (connecting movement instances).

### C2: Theory-Driven Field Critique (26%)

Opens by engaging a theoretical framework or conceptual debate within SMS. Reads as an intervention in a scholarly conversation rather than a response to events. Emphasis on theoretical positioning over empirical preview.

**Best interaction with contribution types**: Theory-Extension, Concept-Building.

### C3: Event-Anchored Narrative (18%)

Most narratively oriented strategy. Opening paragraphs read like journalism or scene-setting. Distinguished by delayed citations — these articles establish empirical ground before engaging literature.

**Best interaction with contribution types**: Gap-Filler (new case), Problem-Driven (policy-relevant events).

### C4: Compact Phenomenon Dispatch (18%)

The minimalist approach. Names a phenomenon, identifies a gap, signals the contribution — all in ~300–500 words. No SMS-specific rhetorical pattern. Reads like a compressed generalist introduction.

**Best interaction with contribution types**: Gap-Filler Minimalist (aligns naturally).

### C5: Dense Phenomenon Mapping (8%)

Extended, citation-dense introductions that map the problem space exhaustively. Distinguished by high citation density (median 24), no roadmap, and long length (median 850 words).

**Best interaction with contribution types**: Concept-Building (building case for new concept), Synthesis (mapping multiple literatures).

## Cluster Selection Guidance

When both a contribution type (from generalist clusters) and an SMS cluster apply:

| If contribution type is... | Consider SMS cluster... | Rationale |
|---------------------------|------------------------|-----------|
| Gap-Filler | C1 (Movement-Wave) or C4 (Compact) | C1 if case is part of a wave; C4 if standalone |
| Theory-Extension | C2 (Field Critique) | Natural match — both center theory |
| Concept-Building | C2 (Field Critique) or C5 (Dense Mapping) | C2 for conceptual debate; C5 for exhaustive grounding |
| Synthesis | C1 (Movement-Wave) or C5 (Dense Mapping) | C1 for cross-case synthesis; C5 for literature integration |
| Problem-Driven | C3 (Event-Anchored) or C1 (Movement-Wave) | C3 for specific events; C1 for broader policy waves |

**Rule**: The contribution-type cluster determines *what* you promise; the SMS cluster determines *how* you open and *what benchmarks* to target.

## SMS Signature Phrases

## SMS-Specific Prohibited Moves

In addition to the general prohibited moves in SKILL.md:

### Don't Do These in SMS Introductions
- **Explaining basic SMS concepts** (collective action frames, repertoires, political opportunity) — the audience knows
- **Selling the importance of studying movements** — SMS readers are pre-committed; stakes-led openings read as naive
- **Ignoring the protest cycle** — if the case is part of a wave, locate it; failing to do so signals unfamiliarity with the field
- **Over-citing in event-anchored openings** — if using a protest-event anchor, let the narrative breathe; citations come later
- **Under-citing in field-reflexive openings** — if engaging a theoretical debate, demonstrate command immediately
- **Using generalist word count targets** — SMS introductions should be shorter; a 950-word introduction will feel bloated

### Don't Do These in SMS Conclusions
- **Including boilerplate limitations** — only ~20% of SMS articles address limitations; adding a generic limitations paragraph signals unfamiliarity with the genre
- **Opening with puzzle restatement** — "This study set out to understand..." is a generalist move; SMS conclusions open with findings summaries
- **Ending with "more research is needed"** — end with a field-reflexive or resonant statement; generic calls for more research are weak codas
- **Skipping the contribution claim** — since SMS often has no separate Discussion, the conclusion must state the contribution explicitly
- **Emphasizing policy over theory** — SMS conclusions default to theoretical implications; policy implications are secondary unless the article is explicitly problem-driven
- **Using generalist conclusion length** — a 300-word SMS conclusion is too short if it's the only closing section; aim for 500–800 when absorbing Discussion functions

## SMS Writing Checklists

### Before Finalizing an SMS Introduction

Verify:

- [ ] **Audience calibration**: Does the introduction assume specialist knowledge? (No basic SMS definitions)
- [ ] **Cycle location**: If the case is part of a protest wave, is the wave named and the case located within it?
- [ ] **Theoretical positioning**: Is the theoretical contribution clear, not just the empirical novelty?
- [ ] **Opening move**: Is the opening move appropriate for SMS? (Avoid stakes-led unless genuinely warranted)
- [ ] **Length**: Is the introduction within SMS benchmarks (340–850 words, 3–5 paragraphs)?
- [ ] **Roadmap**: Is a roadmap present? (Expected in ~69% of SMS articles — include unless the structure is obvious)
- [ ] **Citation timing**: Do citations appear early? (77% cite in ¶1 — engage the literature immediately)
- [ ] **Gap framing**: Is the gap framed theoretically? (46% use theoretical gaps — even empirical studies should signal theoretical stakes)
- [ ] **SMS pattern**: If applicable, is one of the three SMS patterns deployed effectively?

### Before Finalizing an SMS Conclusion

Verify:

- [ ] **Section structure**: Is a standalone conclusion appropriate, or does the article need a separate Discussion? (Conclusion-only is the SMS default)
- [ ] **Length**: Is the conclusion within SMS benchmarks (350–900 words, 3–6 paragraphs)?
- [ ] **Opening move**: Does the conclusion open with a findings summary or contribution claim? (Not a puzzle restatement)
- [ ] **Contribution claim**: Is the contribution stated explicitly? (Essential when there's no separate Discussion)
- [ ] **Limitations**: Are limitations included only if genuinely relevant? (Omit by default — only ~20% of SMS articles include them)
- [ ] **Future directions**: Are future research directions framed as productive next steps? (Present in ~65%)
- [ ] **Callback**: Does the conclusion echo key theoretical vocabulary from the introduction?
- [ ] **Coda**: Does the conclusion end with a field-reflexive statement, resonant declaration, or forward-looking vision? (Not limitations or "more research needed")
- [ ] **Theoretical focus**: Does the conclusion emphasize theoretical over policy implications? (Unless explicitly problem-driven)
