# Field Profile: Social Movements

This field profile adjusts article-bookends guidance for articles targeting social movement studies venues. Based on genre analysis of 80 articles from *Mobilization* (n=41, 1999–2024) and *Social Movement Studies* and related SMS venues (n=39).

## When to Apply This Profile

Apply when the target venue or subfield is social movement studies. Common venues:

- *Mobilization: An International Quarterly*
- *Social Movement Studies*
- *Research in Social Movements, Conflicts and Change*
- Social movements special issues in general journals
- Any article whose primary contribution is to social movement theory

Also consider applying when the article's core topic involves protest, collective action, contentious politics, activism, or social movements — even if targeting a generalist journal — as SMS conventions shape reader expectations.

## Same Genre, Different Tuning

Social movement introductions and conclusions use the same toolkit of moves as generalist sociology — phenomenon-led openings, gap identification, contribution claims, callbacks — but with a distinctly different distribution. No social movements venue invented moves absent from generalist journals; the shift is in which moves get amplified and which get suppressed.

The pattern: as the audience becomes more specialist, authors **sell the phenomenon less** and **engage the theory more**. Generalist readers need to be shown why the topic matters. Social movements readers already know why movements matter — they want to know what theoretical problem you're solving.

Where social movements venues do develop genuine novelty is in **structural patterns** — recurring templates for how to organize an introduction (e.g., surveying a protest wave, then narrowing to a case). These are combinations of standard moves that have hardened into recognizable formulas within the subfield.

**A note on measurement**: The statistics below combine two corpora with somewhat different coding methods. Small percentage differences between venues (e.g., 21% vs. 29% for theory-led openings) likely reflect sampling variability and coding judgment more than genuine venue-level conventions. We flag only large, robust differences as venue-specific.

## How Social Movements Differs from Generalist Sociology

Eight key findings from comparing SMS introductions and conclusions (n=80) to the generalist corpus (n=80, *Social Problems* and *Social Forces*):

| Finding | Generalist | Social Movements | Implication |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| 1. Theory-led openings 4× more common | 6% | 25% | Framework engagement is a primary entry point |
| 2. Phenomenon-led openings less dominant | 74% | 40% | Still the most common move, but no longer the overwhelming default |
| 3. Specialist audience assumed | General framing | Shared vocabulary | Don't explain basic SMS concepts (frames, repertoires, political opportunity) |
| 4. Citations appear early | Middle of intro | 76% cite in ¶1 | Position within scholarly debate immediately |
| 5. Theoretical gaps dominate | Mixed | ~53% theoretical | "New case" is insufficient; show theoretical stakes |
| 6. Conclusions are conclusion-only | Combined D+C common | ~66% conclusion-only | Discussion work gets embedded in findings; don't force a separate Discussion unless needed |
| 7. Field-reflexive codas | Resonant closing image | ~44% field-reflexive | End by positioning findings within SMS debates |
| 8. Stakes-led openings reduced | 11% | ~8% | Audience is pre-committed to the topic; less need to motivate |

**Root pattern**: Social movements venues write for specialists who share vocabulary, care about internal theoretical debates, and need studies located within the subfield's research agenda rather than justified from first principles.

| Citation density | Low (0–4) | **Variable: 0–31, median ~6** | Theory-heavy conclusions cite more |

### Conclusion Opening Moves

| Opening Move | Social Movements % | Description |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Summary-of-findings | ~57% | "This study examined... We found..." |
| Theoretical-framing | ~19% | "The [concept] we proposed illuminates..." |
| Contribution-claim | ~14% | "This article contributes to [debate] by showing..." |
| Puzzle-restatement | ~5% | "We began by asking how..." |
| Other | ~5% | Various |

### Conclusion Coda Types

| Coda Type | Social Movements % | Description | Example Logic |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|---------------|
| Field-reflexive | ~44% | Positions findings within SMS debates | "Scholars of [topic] will need to attend more carefully to [mechanism]" |
| Future-vision | ~23% | Projects forward to what comes next | "Whether [trend] will [outcome] remains an open question" |
| Resonant-statement | ~21% | Declarative sentence crystallizing the contribution | "What appears as [X] is better understood as [Y]" |
| Policy-call | ~7% | Draws out practical implications | Use only when policy stakes are central |
| Other | ~5% | Quote, narrative return | Uncommon |

## Opening Move Distribution

| Opening Move | Generalist | Social Movements (combined) | Δ |
|-------------|-----------|---------------------------|---|
| Phenomenon-led | 74% | **40%** | −34 pp |
| Theory-led | 6% | **25%** | +19 pp |
| Question-led | 1% | **13%** | +12 pp |
| Case-led | 8% | **9%** | +1 pp |
| Stakes-led | 11% | **8%** | −3 pp |
| Quote-led | 0% | **5%** | +5 pp |

**Key shift**: The balanced distribution is the story. Unlike generalist journals where phenomenon-led dominates at 74%, social movements venues distribute across phenomenon, theory, and question moves. Theory-led openings are a primary option, not a niche choice.

## Structural Patterns

Five structural patterns recur across social movements introductions, though at different rates depending on venue. Together they appear in roughly 60–75% of articles; the remainder use no distinctive pattern.

### 1. Movement-Wave Survey

Opens by naming a broad phenomenon — a protest wave, an era of mobilization, a cross-national trend — then surveys multiple instances before narrowing to the specific study.

**Function**: Cycle-location work. Places the study within a broader wave of contention.

**Signature moves**:
- Name a protest cycle or wave
- List multiple movement events, countries, or episodes
- Establish panoramic scope before narrowing
- Data mention early; phenomenon-led opening typical

**When to use**: When the case is part of a larger protest wave and the reader needs panoramic context.

**Example opening logic**: "The [wave/cycle/era] saw mobilizations across [contexts]. In [Country A], [X]; in [Country B], [Y]. Yet [gap]. This article examines [specific case] to [contribution]."

### 2. Field-Reflexive Pivot

Opens with meta-commentary on what SMS has studied and what it has missed, then diagnoses a limitation.

**Function**: Scholarly repositioning. Signals: "The field has focused on X; we turn attention to Y."

**Signature moves**:
- Address SMS's own theoretical debates
- Cite immediately (most cite in ¶1)
- Diagnose a field-level limitation
- Theory-led opening typical; theoretical gap dominant

**When to use**: When the contribution extends existing approaches by redirecting attention to something overlooked.

**Example opening logic**: "[SMS concept/tradition] has been central to how scholars understand [phenomenon]. Yet this framework [limitation]. We propose [alternative/extension] that [contribution]."

### 3. Paradigm-Critique

Opens by challenging an existing theoretical framework or approach. More confrontational than the field-reflexive pivot — not just noting a gap but arguing the field's approach is fundamentally limited.

**Function**: Theoretical intervention. Signals: "The way we've been thinking about X is wrong."

**Signature moves**:
- Open with a direct challenge to existing theory
- Heavy citation in first paragraphs (establishing what you're critiquing)
- Propose an alternative framework or extension
- Theory-led or question-led opening

**When to use**: When the contribution is primarily theoretical — correcting a conceptual limitation or proposing a fundamentally different approach.

**Example opening logic**: "[Theoretical tradition] has dominated understanding of [phenomenon]. Yet this framework [specific limitation]. By [alternative approach], we can see [what's been missed]."

### 4. Debate-Framing

Opens by positioning the study between competing theoretical positions or empirical findings. Frames the article as adjudicating a scholarly disagreement.

**Function**: Debate adjudication. Signals: "Scholars disagree about X; our study provides evidence."

**Signature moves**:
- Present two (or more) competing positions
- Show the tension is empirically unresolved
- Position data as capable of discriminating between positions
- Often includes explicit hypotheses

**When to use**: When competing predictions generate different empirical expectations and your data can speak to both sides.

**Example opening logic**: "Scholars debate whether [X leads to Y or Z]. Some argue [Position 1], while others find [Position 2]. This article uses [data] to evaluate these competing claims."

### 5. Protest-Event Anchor

Anchors the introduction in a specific mobilization event with narrative detail.

**Function**: Case-grounding. Uses a concrete event as the introduction's gravitational center.

**Signature moves**:
- Open with a specific event (date, place, actors)
- Delayed citations — narrative establishes the setting first
- Vivid, journalistic-style prose
- Data always mentioned; case-led opening typical

**When to use**: When a specific event is the case under study and creates a compelling entry point.

**Example opening logic**: "On [date], [actors] [specific action] in [location]. [What happened]. This article draws on [data] to examine [question about this event]."

### Pattern Selection Guidance

| If contribution type is... | Consider pattern... | Rationale |
|---------------------------|---------------------|-----------|
| Gap-Filler | Movement-Wave Survey or no pattern | Wave survey if case is part of a cycle; minimal framing if standalone |
| Theory-Extension | Field-Reflexive Pivot or Paradigm-Critique | Pivot for extensions; Critique for challenges |
| Concept-Building | Paradigm-Critique | Building case for why existing concepts are insufficient |
| Synthesis | Movement-Wave Survey or Field-Reflexive Pivot | Wave survey for cross-case synthesis; Pivot for literature integration |
| Problem-Driven | Protest-Event Anchor or Debate-Framing | Event anchor for specific cases; Debate-Framing for policy disputes |

## Venue-Specific Calibration

Most social movements conventions are shared across venues. But two features show large, robust differences between *Mobilization* and *Social Movement Studies* / similar venues. These differences are large enough (40+ percentage points) to likely reflect genuine venue-level norms rather than sampling noise.

### Roadmaps

| Feature | *Social Movement Studies* etc. | *Mobilization* |
|---------|-------------------------------|----------------|
| Roadmap frequency | **~69%** | **~22%** |
| Implication | Include a roadmap by default | Omit unless structure is complex |

*Mobilization* assumes a specialist audience that can follow the argument without signposting. *Social Movement Studies* serves a broader interdisciplinary readership that benefits from explicit structure.

### Methodological Transparency

| Feature | *Social Movement Studies* etc. | *Mobilization* |
|---------|-------------------------------|----------------|
| Limitations mentioned | **~20%** | **~82%** |
| Future directions | **~65%** | **~97%** |
| Conclusion length (median) | **~600 words** | **~812 words** |

*Mobilization* is a methods-serious journal where bounding your claims is expected. Conclusions are longer because they include limitations and future directions as near-default elements. *Social Movement Studies* treats limitations as optional and writes more compact conclusions.

**Practical implication**: When targeting *Mobilization*, plan for a longer conclusion that includes limitations and future directions. When targeting *Social Movement Studies* or similar venues, write a more compact conclusion and include limitations only if they genuinely matter for interpretation.

### Structural Patterns

Different patterns predominate at different venues, though all patterns appear across the subfield:

| Pattern | *SMS* etc. | *Mobilization* |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| Movement-Wave Survey | ~31% | ~5% |
| Field-Reflexive Pivot | ~26% | ~12% |
| Protest-Event Anchor | ~18% | ~5% |
| Paradigm-Critique | — | ~22% |
| Debate-Framing | — | ~15% |
| No distinctive pattern | ~26% | ~29% |

*SMS* venues lean toward event-driven patterns (wave surveys, event anchors). *Mobilization* leans toward theory-challenge patterns (paradigm-critique, debate-framing). This reflects *Mobilization*'s stronger theoretical orientation.

- "This understudied topic..." (movements are among the most-studied phenomena in sociology)
- "Protests have become increasingly common..." (without specific data on the wave)
- "As recent events have shown..." (vague; name the events)
- "More research is needed" as a coda (end with substance, not a platitude)

## Prohibited Moves

### Don't Do These in Introductions
- **Explaining basic SMS concepts** (collective action frames, repertoires, political opportunity) — the audience knows
- **Selling the importance of studying movements** — SMS readers are pre-committed; stakes-led openings read as naive
- **Ignoring the protest cycle** — if the case is part of a wave, locate it; failing to do so signals unfamiliarity
- **Defaulting to phenomenon-led** — social movements venues use a balanced distribution; theory-led and question-led are just as appropriate
- **Over-citing in event-anchored openings** — if using a protest-event anchor, let the narrative breathe; citations come later
- **Under-citing in field-reflexive or paradigm-critique openings** — if engaging a theoretical debate, demonstrate command immediately

### Don't Do These in Conclusions
- **Opening with puzzle restatement** — "This study set out to understand..." is a generalist move; open with findings or contribution
- **Ending with "more research is needed"** — end with a field-reflexive or resonant statement
- **Skipping the contribution claim** — since separate Discussion sections are uncommon, the conclusion must state the contribution explicitly
- **Emphasizing policy over theory** — conclusions default to theoretical implications; policy is secondary unless the article is explicitly problem-driven
- **Using generalist conclusion length** — a 300-word conclusion is too short if it's the only closing section
- **Ending with limitations** — place limitations in the middle of the conclusion; save the coda for a field-reflexive or forward-looking statement

## Writing Checklists

### Before Finalizing a Social Movements Introduction

Verify:

- [ ] **Audience calibration**: Does the introduction assume specialist knowledge? (No basic SMS definitions)
- [ ] **Opening move**: Is the move appropriate? Theory-led and question-led are as common as phenomenon-led in this subfield.
- [ ] **Cycle location**: If the case is part of a protest wave, is the wave named and the case located within it?
- [ ] **Theoretical positioning**: Is the theoretical contribution clear, not just the empirical novelty?
- [ ] **Length**: Is the introduction within benchmarks (340–1,070 words, 3–8 paragraphs)?
- [ ] **Citation timing**: Do citations appear early? (76% cite in ¶1)
- [ ] **Gap framing**: Is the gap framed theoretically? (~53% use theoretical gaps)
- [ ] **Data mention**: Is the data/method mentioned? (~76% do)
- [ ] **Roadmap**: Venue-calibrate: include for *Social Movement Studies* (69% rate); omit for *Mobilization* unless complex (22% rate)
- [ ] **Structural pattern**: If applicable, is one of the five structural patterns deployed effectively?

### Before Finalizing a Social Movements Conclusion

Verify:

- [ ] **Section structure**: Is a standalone conclusion appropriate? (Conclusion-only is the default at ~66%)
- [ ] **Length**: Is the conclusion within benchmarks (350–1,130 words, 3–12 paragraphs)? Aim longer for *Mobilization*, more compact for *SMS*.
- [ ] **Opening move**: Does the conclusion open with a findings summary, contribution claim, or theoretical framing? (Not a puzzle restatement)
- [ ] **Contribution claim**: Is the contribution stated explicitly?
- [ ] **Limitations**: Venue-calibrate: include for *Mobilization* (82% rate); include only if relevant for *SMS* (~20% rate)
- [ ] **Future directions**: Are future research directions included? (Common across venues; near-universal in *Mobilization*)
- [ ] **Policy implications**: Included only if warranted? (~19% across venues)
- [ ] **Callback**: Does the conclusion echo key theoretical vocabulary from the introduction?
- [ ] **Coda**: Does the conclusion end with a field-reflexive statement, future-vision, or resonant declaration?
- [ ] **Theoretical focus**: Does the conclusion emphasize theoretical over policy implications?
