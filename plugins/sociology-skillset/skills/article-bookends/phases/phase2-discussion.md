# Phase 2: Discussion Drafting

You are drafting the Discussion section for a sociology interview article. Your goal is to **interpret what your findings mean**—connecting them to prior literature, claiming your contribution, and projecting significance.

## Discussion vs. Conclusion: The Simple Rule

- **Discussion** = What does this MEAN? (interpretation, significance, limitations)
- **Conclusion** = How do we CLOSE? (summary, callback, memorable ending)

This phase handles the intellectual heavy lifting. The Conclusion (Phase 3) handles the closure.

## Why This Phase Matters

The Discussion is where your article earns its contribution. Findings alone are just data; Discussion transforms data into knowledge by:
- Connecting to what scholars already know
- Explaining what's new
- Acknowledging what you can't claim
- Projecting why it matters

## The Work Discussion Must Do

| Element | Purpose | Typical Length |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| **Claim contribution** | State what article adds | 1 paragraph |
| **Integrate with literature** | Connect to prior work | 1-2 paragraphs |
| **Acknowledge limitations** | Bound the claims | 1 paragraph |
| **Project implications** | Theoretical/policy significance | 1-2 paragraphs |
| **Future directions** | Point to next steps | 1 paragraph |

**Total target**: 700-1,500 words, 4-10 paragraphs (ASR articles tend toward the upper end)

## Step 1: Choose Your Opening Move

Discussion sections open in one of three ways:

- **Restatement** (~42%): Return to the motivating question or puzzle. "This study set out to understand..."
- **Contribution claim** (~28%): Lead with what you add. "This article advances our understanding of..."
- **Findings summary** (~26%): Open with the key result. "Our analysis reveals that..."

Choose based on your emphasis: restatement if the puzzle drives the article, contribution claim if the theoretical addition is central, findings summary if the results speak loudest.

## Step 2: Claim the Contribution

State explicitly what your article adds. Match to your cluster type:

### Gap-Filler
> "This study contributes to our understanding of [topic] by documenting [empirical insight]. Prior research focused on [X]; we show that [Y]."

### Theory-Extension
> "These findings demonstrate the utility of [framework] for understanding [new domain]. The framework illuminates [specific insight] that prior approaches missed."

### Concept-Building
> "The concept of [new term] provides analytic leverage for understanding [phenomenon]. Unlike [existing concepts], it captures [distinctive feature]."

### Synthesis
> "By connecting [tradition A] and [tradition B], we reveal [integrated insight]. What appeared as separate phenomena are better understood as [unified process]."

### Problem-Driven
> "This analysis advances debates over [topic] by showing [resolution]. The evidence suggests that [position] is more accurate, but [nuance]."

**Key**: Be specific. "Contributes to our understanding" is weak; "documents how X leads to Y through Z mechanism" is strong.

## Step 3: Integrate with Prior Literature

Connect your findings to existing scholarship. This demonstrates field knowledge and positions your contribution.

**Three approaches**:

### Confirming Prior Work
> "These findings align with [Author]'s argument that [claim]. We extend this insight by showing [extension]."

### Challenging Prior Work
> "Contrary to [Author]'s emphasis on [X], we find that [Y] plays a more central role. This suggests [implication]."

### Synthesizing
> "Our findings bridge [Scholar A]'s focus on [X] with [Scholar B]'s attention to [Y], revealing how [connection]."

**Length**: 1-2 paragraphs with citations

**Avoid**: Listing every paper you read. Focus on the 3-5 most relevant works.

## Step 4: Acknowledge Limitations

Limitations are expected (present in 69% of articles). Handle them confidently, not apologetically.

**What to acknowledge**:
- Sample characteristics (size, selection, demographics)
- Geographic/temporal scope
- Methodological constraints
- What you can and cannot claim causally

**What NOT to do**:
- Endless hedging that undermines your contribution
- Listing every conceivable limitation
- Apologizing for your research design

**Template**:
> "This study has limitations. Our sample of [N] [population] in [location] may not generalize to [other contexts]. We cannot establish [causal claim] given [design]. Future research with [different approach] could address these constraints. Despite these limitations, our findings [reaffirm contribution]."

**Length**: 1 paragraph (~100-150 words)

**Critical**: End limitations paragraph by pivoting back to what you CAN claim.

## Step 5: Project Implications

Draw out what your findings mean beyond the immediate study.

### Theoretical Implications
> "These findings suggest that theories of [topic] should attend more carefully to [factor]. The [mechanism] we identify may operate in other contexts where [conditions]."

### Policy Implications
> "For practitioners, these findings suggest [recommendation]. Current policies that [X] may inadvertently [Y]."

### Broader Significance
> "More broadly, this study illuminates [larger phenomenon]. As [trend] continues, understanding [mechanism] becomes increasingly important."

**Length**: 1-2 paragraphs

**Match to cluster**:
- Gap-Filler: Accumulate significance from modest claims
- Theory-Extension: Affirm framework's broader applicability
- Problem-Driven: Emphasize policy implications

## Step 6: Point to Future Directions

Identify productive next steps. This is a research agenda, not a limitations dump.

**Strong future directions**:
- Build on contribution: "Future research might examine whether [mechanism] operates similarly in [new context]"
- Address gaps: "Longitudinal designs could establish [causal claim]"
- Extend framework: "The concept of [X] could be applied to [Y]"

**Weak future directions**:
- "More research is needed" (too vague)
- Repeating limitations as future work

**Length**: 1 paragraph

## Cluster-Specific Adjustments

### Gap-Filler
- Longer implications section (accumulate significance)
- Modest contribution claim is fine
- Connect to multiple literatures to build importance

### Theory-Extension
- Framework affirmation central
- Show how findings vindicate/extend the theory
- May suggest framework refinements

### Concept-Building
- Consolidate concept's utility
- Define scope of applicability
- Compare to existing concepts

### Synthesis
- Return to each tradition named in intro
- Show how integration adds value
- No deflation—deliver the promised synthesis

### Problem-Driven
- Emphasize policy implications
- Connect to real-world stakes
- May be longer on implications, shorter on literature

## Field-Specific Adjustments

When a field profile was identified in Phase 0, apply the field-specific
guidance from `fields/{field}.md`. Field profiles override generalist
defaults where they conflict. Key areas that field profiles may adjust:

- Whether a separate Discussion section is expected or whether Conclusion-only is the norm
- Target word count and citation density
- Limitations expectations (some fields omit them by convention)
- Implications emphasis (theoretical vs. policy)
- Future directions framing

Refer to the field profile's conclusion/discussion benchmarks and writing
checklist for this section.

## Output

Provide:
1. **Complete Discussion draft** (700-1,500 words; adjust per field profile if applicable)
2. **Annotation** noting:
   - Contribution claim type
   - Literatures engaged
   - Limitations acknowledged
   - Implications scope (theoretical/policy/both)
   - If field profile applies: whether separate Discussion is warranted or conclusion-only is preferable

## When You're Done

Return the draft to the orchestrator. The Discussion sets up Phase 3 (Conclusion) for closure.

**The Discussion answers "so what?"**
**The Conclusion answers "and finally..."**
