# Field Profile: Social Movement Studies (SM)

This field profile adjusts contribution-framer guidance for articles targeting social movement studies venues. Based on genre analysis of 82 research articles from *Social Movement Studies* (n=37) and *Mobilization* (n=45).

## When to Apply This Profile

Apply when the target venue or subfield is social movement studies. Common venues:

- *Social Movement Studies*
- *Mobilization*
- *Research in Social Movements, Conflicts and Change*
- Social movements special issues in general journals (e.g., *Sociological Forum*, *Sociological Perspectives*)
- Any article whose primary contribution is to social movement theory

Also apply when the article's core topic involves protest, collective action, activism, contentious politics, or mobilization — even if targeting a generalist journal — as social movement conventions shape reader expectations.

## How SM Differs from Generalist Sociology

7 key findings from comparing SM contribution framing (n=82) to the flagship corpus (n=115, *AJS*, *ASR*, *Social Problems*, *Social Forces*):

| Finding | Flagships | SM | Implication |
|---------|-----------|-----|-------------|
| Process-Tracing prevalence | ~27% | **6%** | PT is almost absent; mechanism-mapping articles are rare at field journals |
| Gap-Filler prevalence | ~9% | **21%** | GF is rehabilitated; field journals accept empirical gap-filling without high theoretical ambition |
| Factor-Identifying at Mobilization | ~24% | **38%** | FI dominates at Mobilization specifically (quantitative adjudication niche) |
| Concept-Building scope | High-abstraction | **Mid-range, domain-specific** | CB concepts tend to stay close to their empirical cases rather than aspiring to general social theory |
| Non-standard article types | ~0% | **~10%** | Field journals publish methodological papers, review/agenda-setting pieces, movement profiles, and debate-interventions |
| Threading strength | Strong (90%+) | **Moderate** | Threading of 5-8 key terms across all sections is less consistently enforced |
| TE theoretical anchors | Middle-range, operationalizable | **Named European frameworks** | TE articles at SMS lean toward Bourdieu, Polanyi, historical institutionalism rather than American middle-range theory |

**Root pattern**: Field-specific journals reward adjudication and domain-specific concept-building over mechanism-mapping. Threading standards are looser, and Gap-Filler articles that would be risky at flagships are routine.

## Adjusted Contribution Type Distribution

### SM Combined (SMS + Mobilization)

| Type | Flagship % | SM % | Δ | Guidance |
|------|-----------|------|---|----------|
| **Process-Tracing** | ~27% | 6% | -21 | Rare; only 5 of 82 articles. Don't default to PT framing for field journals |
| **Concept-Building** | ~27% | 34% | +7 | Modal type. Concepts can be mid-range and domain-specific |
| **Factor-Identifying** | ~24% | 30% | +6 | Strong, especially at *Mobilization* (38%). Adjudication framing well-rewarded |
| **Theory-Extension** | ~11% | 9% | -2 | Similar rate. European frameworks more common than American middle-range |
| **Gap-Filler** | ~9% | 21% | +12 | Significantly more accepted. Qualitative GF is viable without penalty |

### Venue-Specific Calibration

| Journal | CB | FI | GF | PT | TE | Character |
|---------|----|----|----|----|-----|-----------|
| *Social Movement Studies* | **33%** | 22% | **31%** | 6% | 11% | CB-heavy, GF-tolerant, qualitative-friendly |
| *Mobilization* | 36% | **38%** | 13% | 7% | 7% | FI-heavy, quantitative adjudication niche |
| *AJS* | ~27% | ~27% | ~6% | **~33%** | ~6% | PT-dominant, mechanism-heavy |
| *ASR* | **32%** | ~21% | 6% | ~24% | ~12% | CB-modal, GF-rare |
| *SP/SF* | ~24% | ~22% | ~12% | ~24% | ~14% | Most balanced distribution |

## Decision Tree Adjustments for SM

The same 5-question decision tree applies, but calibration shifts:

### 1. Gap-Filler Is Not a Warning Sign
At flagships, GF triggers a "consider reframing" warning. **At SM venues, GF is a normal, well-accepted contribution type.** Do not pressure users to reframe GF as PT or CB when targeting SMS or Mobilization.

### 2. Process-Tracing Is Unusual
At flagships (especially AJS), PT is the dominant mode. **At SM venues, PT is rare (6%).** If a user's article naturally traces a mechanism, it may be better positioned at a flagship journal. If targeting SM venues, consider whether the mechanism-tracing can be reframed as FI (adjudicating whether the mechanism or an alternative explains the outcome) or CB (naming the mechanism as a new concept).

### 3. Concept-Building Can Be Domain-Specific
At flagships, CB articles coin high-abstraction concepts that aspire to general social theory. **At SM venues, mid-range, domain-specific concepts are standard.** Concepts like "citizenism," "politics of mundanity," "discursive eruption," "social movement schools," "thin/thick identity" — closely tied to specific empirical cases — are normal and welcomed. Don't push users toward excessive abstraction.

### 4. Factor-Identifying Is Especially Strong at Mobilization
If targeting *Mobilization* specifically, FI is the plurality mode (38%). The journal has a niche in quantitative adjudication of competing explanations. Articles with clear "not X but Y" framing, hypothesis testing, and competing-model designs are well-positioned here.

### 5. Theory-Extension Leans European
TE articles at SMS tend to extend named European social theories (Bourdieu, Polanyi, historical institutionalism, critical junctures) rather than American middle-range theory. If extending a European framework to social movement dynamics, SMS and Mobilization are natural venues.

## Non-Standard Article Types at SM Venues

Unlike flagships, SM venues publish article types that fall outside the 5-type contribution typology:

| Type | n | Venues | Description |
|------|---|--------|-------------|
| **Review/Agenda-Setting** | 4 | SMS, Mobilization | Synthesizes existing literature and sets research priorities; no new data |
| **Methodological** | 2 | Mobilization | Methods papers on measurement or data architecture |
| **Movement Profile** | 1 | SMS | Descriptive-journalistic account of a specific protest |
| **Debate-Intervention/Critique** | 1 | Mobilization | Critical essay targeting the field's assumptions |

**Implication**: If the user's contribution is primarily methodological, review-oriented, or a critical essay, contribution-framer may not apply. Flag this and advise accordingly.

## Threading Adjustments

### Threading Strength
At flagships, 90%+ of articles thread 5-8 key terms strongly across all sections. **At SM venues, threading is often moderate** — key terms appear but don't saturate every section. This reflects looser editorial pressure toward unified argumentative architecture.

**Recommendation**: Still generate a full threading vocabulary (the profile should aspire to strong threading), but note that SM venues are more forgiving of moderate threading. Users don't need to force every threading term into every section.

### Threading by Type at SM Venues

| Type | Typical Threading Strength | Notes |
|------|---------------------------|-------|
| CB | Strong when concept is coined; moderate when concept is more descriptive | Coined terms ("citizenism," "INsD") thread strongly; broader concepts less so |
| FI | Strong when rival hypotheses are sharply named | "Backlash vs. mobilization," "radical flank" thread well |
| GF | Moderate | Gap-filling vocabulary is inherently less distinctive; focus on 2-3 key terms |
| PT | Strong (but rare) | The few PT articles that exist thread mechanism vocabulary consistently |
| TE | Strong when framework name is used as an adjective | "Bourdieusian," "Polanyian" thread effectively |

## Signature Phrases by Type at SM Venues

### CB at SM Venues
- "We propose the concept of..."
- "We develop the concept of [X] to capture..."
- "[Coined term] refers to..."
- "The [X] framework helps us understand..."
- Typology language: "three forms of," "four dimensions of"

### FI at SM Venues
- "Contrary to [X], we find..."
- "Which [factors/conditions] explain..."
- "We test competing explanations for..."
- "The results support the [X] model over the [Y] model"
- "Not [X] but [Y] drives..."

### GF at SM Venues
- "Little research has examined [X] in the context of [Y]"
- "We fill this gap by..."
- "This is the first study to..."
- "We contribute to the literature on [X] by showing..."
- Enumerated contribution lists are common and accepted

## Field-Specific Prohibited Moves

In addition to the general prohibited moves in SKILL.md:

### Don't Do These When Targeting SM Venues
- **Don't frame GF as inadequate** — Gap-filling is a legitimate contribution at field journals; don't push users to "upgrade" to PT or CB
- **Don't expect AJS-style mechanism development** — Extended mechanism elaboration (2-4 paragraphs in the introduction) is an AJS convention, not an SM one
- **Don't require high-abstraction concept-building** — Domain-specific, mid-range concepts are standard and valued
- **Don't assume quantitative methods are necessary** — SMS in particular publishes qualitative GF and CB articles routinely; Mobilization is more quantitative but not exclusively so
- **Don't dismiss review/agenda-setting contributions** — These are real article types at field journals, even if they fall outside the 5-type typology

## Writing Checklists

### Before Finalizing an SM Contribution Profile

Verify:

- [ ] **Type matches venue**: If GF, confirm the user is not targeting a flagship where GF is risky
- [ ] **Concept scope is appropriate**: If CB, the concept can be domain-specific for SM venues — don't push toward excessive abstraction
- [ ] **Adjudication is sharp**: If FI (especially at Mobilization), the competing explanations are clearly named and the adjudication is explicit
- [ ] **Threading is realistic**: Generate full threading vocabulary but note SM venues are forgiving of moderate threading
- [ ] **Non-standard type flagged**: If the article is methodological, review-oriented, or a critique, note that the 5-type typology may not apply
- [ ] **Venue-specific calibration applied**: SMS and Mobilization have different distributions — don't treat them as interchangeable
