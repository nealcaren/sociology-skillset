# Cluster: Concept-Building

**Prevalence**: ~27% of corpus (most common, tied with Process-Tracing; modal type at ASR at 32%)

**Contribution logic**: "We introduce a new concept (or redefine an existing one) that captures a phenomenon existing categories miss."

## Identifying Concept-Building Articles

Your article is Concept-Building if:
- A new term is coined or an existing concept is substantially redefined
- The theory section motivates a conceptual lacuna (existing concepts are inadequate, not just understudied)
- The concept is built inductively through data and consolidated in the conclusion

**Key indicators**:
- Coined term appears in the title or abstract
- Introduction shows existing concepts are inadequate
- Findings organized around the concept's dimensions or components
- Conclusion consolidates the concept and demonstrates its portability
- Signal phrases: "we introduce," "we term," "the concept of," "I call," "we define"

## Cross-Section Template

### Abstract
**Function**: Name the concept as the result of the study, not the starting point. The coined term should appear, but as something the article produces.

**Signature pattern**: "[Phenomenon]. Existing frameworks [inadequacy]. Drawing on [data], we develop the concept of [coined term] — [definition]. [Concept] captures [what it illuminates]. [Implications]."

### Introduction
**Function**: Open with a phenomenon, show existing concepts are inadequate, and preview the new concept.

**Structure**:
1. **Opening** (1-2 paragraphs): Phenomenon that existing concepts can't fully explain
2. **Conceptual inadequacy** (1-2 paragraphs): What existing frameworks get wrong or miss
3. **Concept preview** (1-2 paragraphs): Introduce the coined term and its core logic
4. **Study preview** (1 paragraph): Data and approach

The introduction may be longer than Process-Tracing because motivating the conceptual need requires showing what existing tools miss.

### Theory/Literature Review
**Function**: Build the case that existing concepts are inadequate — not that the topic is understudied. The gap is conceptual, not empirical.

**Structure**:
1. **Existing frameworks**: What concepts have been used to study this phenomenon?
2. **Inadequacy diagnosis**: What do they miss, conflate, or get wrong?
3. **Conceptual genealogy**: Intellectual resources the new concept draws from
4. **Concept development**: Full definition and specification of the new concept's components/dimensions

**Key move**: The theory section must make the reader feel that existing concepts are genuinely insufficient — that a new tool is needed, not just wanted.

### Methods
**Function**: Explain how the data and design are suited to build/reveal the concept. Case selection should be justified in terms of concept development — strategic cases, extreme cases, or comparison cases that illuminate dimensions.

### Findings
**Function**: Build the concept inductively through data. Each findings subsection reveals one dimension or component of the concept.

**Structure**: Organized around the concept's dimensions, not around data sources or chronological order. The concept should feel like it's being assembled before the reader's eyes.

**Key move**: Show the concept doing analytical work — illuminating patterns that existing concepts could not.

### Conclusion
**Function**: Consolidate the concept, demonstrate its portability, and defend against likely objections.

**Structure**:
1. **Consolidation** (1-2 paragraphs): Restate the concept and its definition
2. **Portability** (2-3 paragraphs): Show the concept travels beyond the specific case — other domains, populations, or contexts where it applies
3. **Defensive framing** (1 paragraph): Address likely objections (is this just a relabeling? is it too narrow?)
4. **Implications** (1-2 paragraphs): What the concept changes about how we think

## Vocabulary Threading

Concept-Building articles thread these term categories:

| Category | Examples | Required Sections |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| **Coined term** | "flexible austerity," "positioning stories," "ambivalent reproduction" | Title, Abstract, Intro, Findings headers, Conclusion |
| **Definitional vocabulary** | The concept's components or dimensions | Theory, Findings |
| **Inadequacy vocabulary** | What existing concepts miss | Intro, Theory, recalled in Conclusion |
| **Domain vocabulary** | The empirical case | Intro opening, Methods, Conclusion portability |

**Threading strength**: Strong — coined terms thread obsessively. The term itself is the most visible threading element.

## Signature Moves (Do This)

### 1. Motivate the Conceptual Lacuna
Show WHY existing concepts fail, not just THAT the topic is understudied. The gap is in our conceptual toolkit, not our empirical knowledge.

> "Unlike previous work, I find U.S.-based workers tell a mixture of individualizing and structure-focused stories, and I trace these stories to particular structural features of precarious work."
> — Griesbach (2025), ASR

### 2. Define Precisely
The coined term should have a single, quotable definition — a sentence that could serve as a dictionary entry.

> "I define flexible austerity as the process through which workers see new resource shortages as legitimating greater restraint in how they allocate supplies, but use discretion in applying this restraint, often enforcing it unequally."
> — Brewer (2024), ASR

### 3. Build Through Data
The concept is not imposed top-down — it emerges from the data. Findings sections reveal dimensions one by one.

### 4. Demonstrate Portability
The conclusion must show the concept travels. It's not a local description — it's a portable analytical tool that illuminates other settings.

## Prohibited Moves (Don't Do This)

### 1. Concept Without Definition
**Why to avoid**: A coined term without a precise definition is just a label. Reviewers will demand to know what distinguishes it from existing concepts.

### 2. Imposing the Concept Top-Down
**Why to avoid**: If the concept is fully formed before the findings, you're doing Theory-Extension (applying an existing framework), not Concept-Building (deriving a new one from data).

### 3. Deflating in the Conclusion
**Why to avoid**: CB has the highest deflation risk. If the conclusion retreats from "we introduce the concept of X" to "our findings suggest," the concept loses force. Zero deflation tolerance.

### 4. Enumerating Multiple Contributions
**Why to avoid**: The concept IS the contribution. Don't dilute it with an enumerated list. One concept, developed fully, is more powerful than three weakly specified contributions.

## Exemplar

**Brewer (2024), "Flexible Austerity: Negotiating the Unequal Effects of Resource Shortages in Racialized Organizations"** — ASR

- **Why exemplary**: Coins "flexible austerity," gives a precise one-sentence definition, builds it inductively from ethnographic data (before/after shortage comparison), and extends it beyond healthcare to organizational inequality
- **Concept**: Flexible austerity — workers treat restrictive allocation as necessity for "undeserving" groups but optional for "deserving" groups
- **Threading terms**: "flexible austerity," "resource shortages," "deservingness," "colorblind," "racialized organizations"

**Griesbach (2025), "Positioning Stories: Accounting for Insecure Work"** — ASR

- **Why exemplary**: Coins "positioning stories," shows existing individualization framework is inadequate, builds concept through 120 interviews across four worker groups, reveals dimensions through systematic comparison
- **Threading terms**: "positioning stories," "positional uncertainty," "temporal/spatial instability," "precarity," "narrative fragmentation"

## Journal Calibration

Concept-Building is the **ASR signature type** — modal at 32% vs. 25% at SP/SF. ASR rewards conceptual innovation. Articles targeting ASR should have a clearly coined term with a precise definition and demonstrated portability.

At SP/SF, Concept-Building is viable but less dominant. The concept may face more scrutiny about whether it's genuinely new or just a relabeling.
