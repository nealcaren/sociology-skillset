# Cluster: Factor-Identifying

**Prevalence**: ~24% of corpus (third most common)

**Contribution logic**: "We show WHICH factor matters by adjudicating between competing explanations — not X but Y, or X rather than Y."

## Identifying Factor-Identifying Articles

Your article is Factor-Identifying if:
- The article poses competing explanations with roughly equal theoretical weight
- The findings adjudicate between these accounts (one wins, others lose or are qualified)
- The conclusion declares a winner and explains why the losing accounts fail

**Key indicators**:
- Abstract uses "contrary to," "not X but Y," "which factor," or "rather than"
- Theory section reviews competing accounts in parallel subsections
- Methods designed to adjudicate (comparative cases, mediation, natural experiments)
- Findings organized by comparative tests, each account getting a verdict
- Signal phrases: "contrary to," "not X but Y," "which factor," "rather than," "competing explanations"

## Cross-Section Template

### Abstract
**Function**: State the puzzle and which explanation wins.

**Signature pattern**: "[Puzzle/phenomenon]. Competing accounts emphasize [Account A] and [Account B]. Using [data/method], we find [Account X] better explains [outcome]. Contrary to [Account Y], [specific finding]. [Implication]."

### Introduction
**Function**: Pose the puzzle and present competing explanations as genuinely viable alternatives.

**Structure**:
1. **Opening** (1-2 paragraphs): The puzzle or phenomenon that multiple theories address
2. **Competing accounts** (2-4 paragraphs): Present each explanation with its logic, evidence base, and predictions — each gets approximately equal space
3. **This study** (1-2 paragraphs): How this article will adjudicate between accounts

**Key move**: The competing accounts must feel genuinely plausible. If one is obviously a straw man, the adjudication is trivial.

### Theory/Literature Review
**Function**: Review each competing account in parallel subsections, deriving testable predictions from each.

**Structure**:
1. **Account A**: Full review — logic, evidence, predictions
2. **Account B**: Full review — logic, evidence, predictions
3. **Account C** (if applicable): Full review
4. **Summary of predictions**: Table or paragraph laying out what each account predicts for this study

**Key move**: Each account gets its own subsection (or clearly demarcated paragraphs) with roughly equal depth. The theory section reads as a genuine intellectual contest, not a setup.

### Methods
**Function**: Explain why the research design can distinguish between accounts.

The methods section must justify the design in terms of adjudication — comparative cases chosen to maximize leverage between accounts, mediation analysis to test causal pathways, natural experiments that differentially activate competing mechanisms.

### Findings
**Function**: Deliver verdicts on each competing account, organized by comparative tests.

**Structure**: Each subsection tests one account or one comparison. The subsection headers should signal which account is being evaluated.

**Key move**: Clear verdicts. Each account gets an explicit result — supported, partially supported, or refuted. Don't leave it ambiguous.

### Conclusion
**Function**: Declare the winning account, explain why losing accounts fail, and note boundary conditions.

**Structure**:
1. **Verdict** (1-2 paragraphs): Which account wins and what the evidence shows
2. **Losing accounts** (1-2 paragraphs): WHY the alternatives fail — not just that they didn't get support, but what they get wrong
3. **Boundary conditions** (1 paragraph): When might the losing account actually apply?
4. **Implications** (1-2 paragraphs): What does the verdict mean for theory and research?

## Vocabulary Threading

Factor-Identifying articles thread these term categories:

| Category | Examples | Required Sections |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| **Account labels** | "the cultural explanation," "the structural account," "the selection hypothesis" | Intro, Theory (subsection headers), Findings, Conclusion |
| **Adjudication vocabulary** | "contrary to," "consistent with," "fails to account for" | Findings, Conclusion |
| **Winning-account vocabulary** | Key terms from the winning explanation | Abstract, Conclusion (dominant) |
| **Puzzle vocabulary** | Terms describing the phenomenon to be explained | Intro opening, Conclusion return |

**Threading pattern**: Account labels thread most visibly — they appear as theory subsection headers and are recalled in findings verdicts and conclusion.

## Signature Moves (Do This)

### 1. Give Competing Accounts Equal Setup
Each account gets its own theory subsection with genuine depth. Reviewers will reject the article if alternatives are straw men.

### 2. Design for Adjudication
The methods section must explain why the design can distinguish between accounts — not just test one explanation.

### 3. Deliver Clear Verdicts
Each competing account gets an explicit verdict in the findings. "The evidence does not support Account B" is clearer than "these results complicate Account B."

### 4. Explain Why the Loser Fails
The conclusion must explain WHY the losing account gets it wrong — not just note the absence of support. This deepens the theoretical contribution.

## Prohibited Moves (Don't Do This)

### 1. Straw-Manning Alternatives
**Why to avoid**: If competing accounts are obviously weak, the adjudication is trivial and reviewers will question why it was needed.

### 2. Declaring a Draw
**Why to avoid**: "Both accounts receive some support" is a Gap-Filler conclusion, not a Factor-Identifying one. If you promise adjudication, deliver a verdict.

### 3. Testing Only One Account
**Why to avoid**: If you only test your preferred explanation, you're doing Process-Tracing (tracing a mechanism) or Gap-Filling (documenting a pattern), not Factor-Identifying.

### 4. Losing the Accounts in the Findings
**Why to avoid**: If findings are organized by variables or models rather than by competing accounts, the adjudication structure is lost. Keep the accounts visible.

## Exemplar

**Cole (2025), "Abortion Policies in a Polarizing World Society, 1970 to 2020"** — ASR

- **Why exemplary**: Distills four theoretical models of global contestation (impediment, backlash, decoupling, polarization), derives testable predictions from each, tests all four with panel data across 160 countries, and declares polarization the winner
- **Adjudication**: Four models reviewed in parallel; each model's empirical predictions tested; clear verdict with boundary conditions
- **Threading terms**: "liberal/illiberal," "contestation," "polarization," "INGOs," "institutionalization"
