# Cluster: Process-Tracing

**Prevalence**: ~27% of corpus (most common, tied with Concept-Building)

**Contribution logic**: "We show HOW this phenomenon works by identifying and tracing a mechanism, pathway, or set of sequential stages."

---

## Identifying Process-Tracing Articles

Your article is Process-Tracing if:
- The core contribution names a causal process, mechanism, or pathway
- Findings are organized by sequential stages, steps, or phases
- The article promises to show HOW something produces an outcome

**Key indicators**:
- Mechanism is named in abstract and echoed across all sections
- Theory section derives mechanism steps from prior literature
- Findings subsections correspond to mechanism stages
- Conclusion affirms the mechanism worked and generalizes to new domains
- Signal phrases: "works through," "the mechanism by which," "produces," "sequential," "pathway"

## Cross-Section Template

### Abstract
**Function**: Name the mechanism and promise to show how it works.

The abstract should state the mechanism by name and preview its operation. The reader should leave the abstract knowing what process is being traced and what it produces.

**Signature pattern**: "[Phenomenon]. We identify [mechanism name] — [brief definition]. [Mechanism] operates through [key stages]. [Outcome]."

### Introduction
**Function**: Open with a phenomenon or case, name the mechanism, and develop it over 2-4 paragraphs.

The mechanism should be named by the end of the third paragraph. No roadmap, no enumerated contribution list. The introduction IS the mechanism preview.

**Structure**:
1. **Opening** (1-2 paragraphs): Phenomenon, case, or question that motivates the study
2. **Mechanism introduction** (1 paragraph): Name the mechanism and define it
3. **Mechanism development** (2-3 paragraphs): Develop the mechanism's logic, previewing the stages or steps
4. **Study preview** (1 paragraph): Brief description of data and approach

**Target length**: 900-1,400 words

### Theory/Literature Review
**Function**: Build toward the mechanism by establishing what's known, identifying the missing process, and deriving mechanism steps from the literature.

**Structure**:
1. **Genealogy of the problem**: What do we know about the phenomenon?
2. **The missing process**: What's the gap? The gap should be a missing HOW, not a missing THAT
3. **Mechanism derivation**: Draw on existing theories to derive the mechanism's steps or stages
4. **Expectations or propositions**: State what the mechanism predicts (optional)

**Key move**: The theory section should make the mechanism feel inevitable — like the natural conclusion of the literature review.

### Methods
**Function**: Explain why the research design can trace/reveal the process.

The methods section must justify the design in terms of its ability to capture sequential processes — not just test for effects. Process-tracing designs often feature longitudinal data, before/after comparisons, or sequential case analysis.

### Findings
**Function**: Trace the mechanism through the data, with subsections organized by mechanism stages.

**Structure**: Each subsection corresponds to one stage of the mechanism. The subsection headers themselves tell the mechanism story.

**Key move**: The findings should read like a narrative of the process unfolding — stage by stage, with evidence for each step.

### Conclusion
**Function**: Affirm the mechanism demonstrated, generalize to new domains, and callback to the opening.

**Structure**:
1. **Affirmation** (1-2 paragraphs): State that the mechanism works as described
2. **Generalization** (2-3 paragraphs): Extend the mechanism to new domains, populations, or contexts
3. **Implications** (1-2 paragraphs): What does this mechanism mean for theory and practice?
4. **Callback** (optional): Return to the opening case or phenomenon

**Target length**: 1,200-2,200 words (typically 1.4× introduction length)

## Vocabulary Threading

Process-Tracing articles thread these term categories:

| Category | Examples | Required Sections |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| **Mechanism name** | "selective empathy," "flexible austerity" | Abstract, Intro, every Findings subsection, Conclusion |
| **Stage vocabulary** | "first," "then," "subsequently," "through" | Theory, Methods rationale, Findings |
| **Domain vocabulary** | Terms specific to the empirical case | Intro opening, Methods, Conclusion generalization |
| **Outcome vocabulary** | What the mechanism produces | Abstract, Findings (final subsection), Conclusion |

**Threading strength**: Strong (90%+ of PT articles thread 5-8 terms)

## Signature Moves (Do This)

### 1. Name the Mechanism Early
The mechanism should be named in the abstract and within the first 3 paragraphs of the introduction. Don't bury it.

> "To explain this pattern, we introduce a novel theoretical lens we term 'selective empathy' — that is, in evaluating pricing arrangements, individuals disproportionately direct their empathy to one exchange partner or the other, taking the perspective of either the company or the customer."
> — Kiviat & Knight (2026), ASR

### 2. Organize Findings by Mechanism Stages
Each findings subsection traces one step of the process. The subsection headers should read as a sequential narrative of the mechanism in action.

### 3. Affirm and Generalize in the Conclusion
The conclusion does not retreat to "consistent with." It affirms the mechanism demonstrated and extends it to new contexts.

> "Selective empathy specifies one way that emotions and perspective-taking play a role. Beyond economic self-interest and neoliberal ideology, higher-income individuals exhibit an empathetic orientation toward capital."
> — Kiviat & Knight (2026), ASR

### 4. Design Methods Around the Process
Explain why the research design can capture the mechanism — not just detect an effect.

---

## Prohibited Moves (Don't Do This)

### 1. Burying the Mechanism
**Why to avoid**: If the mechanism is not named until the findings, the reader has no framework for interpreting the evidence. Name it by the end of the introduction.

### 2. Organizing Findings by Data Source
**Why to avoid**: Findings should follow mechanism stages, not "interviews showed X, surveys showed Y." Data should serve the process narrative.

### 3. Retreating to Correlation in the Conclusion
**Why to avoid**: "Our findings are consistent with" is a Gap-Filler conclusion, not a Process-Tracing one. Affirm the mechanism.

### 4. Enumerating Contributions
**Why to avoid**: Enumerated contribution lists ("we contribute in three ways") signal Gap-Filler framing. Process-Tracing articles have one contribution: the mechanism.

## Exemplar

**Kiviat & Knight (2026), "Seeing Like a Company or a Customer: Selective Empathy in Pricing"** — ASR

- **Why exemplary**: Names the mechanism ("selective empathy") in the abstract, traces it through experimental and survey data, affirms it in the conclusion, generalizes to broader questions about relational pricing and class
- **Mechanism**: Selective empathy — people differentially empathize with companies vs. consumers based on class position
- **Threading terms**: "selective empathy," "pricing fairness," "perspective-taking," "company/consumer," "class"
