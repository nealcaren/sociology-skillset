# Cluster: Gap-Filler

**Prevalence**: ~9% of corpus (least common; drops from ~10% at SP/SF to 6% at ASR)

**Contribution logic**: "We are the first to document [phenomenon] in [context], filling an empirical gap in the literature."

## Identifying Gap-Filler Articles

Your article is Gap-Filler if:
- The primary contribution is documenting something where little prior work exists
- Contributions are enumerated ("We contribute in three ways...")
- The theory section is organized around what's known vs. not known
- Contributions are delivered sequentially in the findings

**Key indicators**:
- "First to," "bridges," "little research has" in the abstract
- Enumerated contribution list in the introduction
- Findings organized by contribution claims, not by a mechanism or concept
- Conclusion re-enumerates contributions as established findings
- Signal phrases: "first to," "little research has," "we contribute by," "bridges," "extends prior work"

## Cross-Section Template

### Abstract
**Function**: Signal the gap and enumerate the contributions.

**Signature pattern**: "[Phenomenon] is [important/consequential]. Although prior research has [what's known], we know less about [gap]. Using [data], we find [finding 1], [finding 2], and [finding 3]. These findings [implications]."

### Introduction
**Function**: Open with the phenomenon, identify the gap, and enumerate contributions.

**Structure**:
1. **Opening** (1-2 paragraphs): Phenomenon-led or stakes-led opening
2. **What we know** (1-2 paragraphs): Brief review of existing knowledge
3. **The gap** (1 paragraph): "Little research has examined..." / "We know less about..."
4. **Contributions** (1-2 paragraphs): Enumerated list ("We contribute in three ways: First... Second... Third...")
5. **Study preview** (1 paragraph): Data and approach

**Key move**: The gap must be specific and verifiable. Not "we know little about inequality" but "we know little about how X affects Y in Z context."

### Theory/Literature Review
**Function**: Organized around what's known vs. not known. The literature review builds toward the gap.

**Structure**:
1. **What prior research establishes**: Key findings in the area
2. **What remains unknown**: The specific gap this study fills
3. **Why the gap matters**: Theoretical or practical significance
4. **Expectations or hypotheses** (optional): What we might expect to find

### Methods
**Function**: Standard methods section. No special design justification needed beyond appropriateness for the gap.

### Findings
**Function**: Contributions delivered sequentially. Each enumerated contribution from the introduction gets its own findings subsection.

**Structure**: Subsections correspond 1:1 to the enumerated contributions. The order matches the introduction's promise.

### Conclusion
**Function**: Re-enumerate contributions as established findings and discuss implications.

**Structure**:
1. **Summary** (1-2 paragraphs): Restate the gap and what the study found
2. **Re-enumeration** (2-3 paragraphs): Each contribution restated as an established finding (not a promise)
3. **Implications** (2-3 paragraphs): Theoretical, practical, or policy implications
4. **Limitations and future directions** (1 paragraph)

## Vocabulary Threading

Gap-Filler articles thread these term categories:

| Category | Examples | Required Sections |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| **Gap vocabulary** | "little research," "understudied," "first to," "we know less" | Abstract, Intro, Theory |
| **Enumeration vocabulary** | "first," "second," "third," "additionally" | Intro (as promises), Conclusion (as findings) |
| **Contribution-claim vocabulary** | "we contribute by," "this study extends," "we bridge" | Intro, Conclusion |
| **Implication vocabulary** | "these findings suggest," "implications for policy" | Conclusion |

**Threading strength**: Moderate to strong. Gap-Filler articles have the weakest threading of the five types because contributions are enumerated rather than unified under a single term. Aim for 4-6 threading terms.

## Signature Moves (Do This)

### 1. Identify the Gap Clearly
The gap must be specific and verifiable: "little research has examined [X] in [Y] context." Not vague gestures toward an under-researched area.

### 2. Enumerate Contributions
Gap-Filler is the one type where enumeration is expected and appropriate. "We contribute in three ways: First... Second... Third..."

### 3. Deliver Contributions Sequentially
Each enumerated contribution gets its own findings subsection, delivered in the order promised in the introduction.

### 4. Re-Enumerate in the Conclusion
The conclusion mirrors the introduction's contribution list, now stated as established findings rather than promises.

---

## Prohibited Moves (Don't Do This)

### 1. Over-Claiming
**Why to avoid**: Gap-Filler articles should not claim to overturn theory or introduce revolutionary concepts. The contribution is empirical documentation, and that's sufficient.

### 2. Burying the Gap
**Why to avoid**: If the gap isn't identified until page 5, the reader doesn't know why the study matters. Identify it within the first 2-3 paragraphs.

### 3. Mixing with Higher-Ambition Moves
**Why to avoid**: If you enumerate contributions but also coin a concept, you're Concept-Building. If you enumerate but also trace a mechanism, you're Process-Tracing. Gap-Filler is the pure empirical-documentation type. Don't dilute it.

### 4. Promising More Than You Deliver
**Why to avoid**: If you enumerate three contributions in the introduction but only deliver two in the findings, the article has a coherence problem. Match promises to delivery exactly.

## Journal Stratification Warning

Gap-Filler is the most journal-stratified type:
- **SP/SF**: ~10% — viable and accepted
- **ASR**: ~6% — rare, higher bar
- **AJS**: Uncommon — strong conceptual framing expected

If targeting AJS or ASR, consider whether your Gap-Filler study can be strengthened by:
- **Adding a mechanism** → reframe as Process-Tracing
- **Coining a term** → reframe as Concept-Building
- **Posing competing explanations** → reframe as Factor-Identifying

This isn't about being dishonest — it's about recognizing that what looks like a "gap" often contains an unrecognized mechanism or an implicit concept that can be made explicit.

## Exemplar

Gap-Filler exemplars are most common in SP/SF. They feature clear gap identification, precisely enumerated contributions (typically 2-4), and sequential delivery. The best Gap-Filler articles make the gap seem consequential and the findings genuinely informative, even without conceptual novelty.
