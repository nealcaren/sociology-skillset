# Cluster: Theory-Extension

**Prevalence**: ~11% of corpus (fourth most common)

**Contribution logic**: "We extend [named framework] to [new domain], showing it illuminates phenomena the original formulation did not address."

## Identifying Theory-Extension Articles

Your article is Theory-Extension if:
- A named theoretical framework is identified early and applied to a new domain
- The theory section is scaffolded as a genealogy of the framework
- Framework terms serve as analytic descriptors in the findings
- The conclusion affirms the framework and notes boundary conditions

**Key indicators**:
- Framework name appears in the title or first paragraph
- Theory section traces the framework's intellectual history
- Methods operationalize framework constructs
- Findings subsections use framework terms as organizing concepts
- Signal phrases: "extending," "applying X to Y," "building on [framework]," framework canonical terms

## Cross-Section Template

### Abstract
**Function**: Name the framework and the new domain together. The abstract signals both what tradition this extends and what new territory it covers.

**Signature pattern**: "[Framework] has illuminated [prior domain]. We extend it to [new domain] using [data]. We find [framework construct] explains [phenomenon in new domain]. [Implications for the tradition]."

### Introduction
**Function**: Introduce the framework early — within the first 2-3 paragraphs. May open with a phenomenon or directly with the theory.

**Structure**:
1. **Opening** (1-2 paragraphs): Theory-led or phenomenon-led opening that quickly reaches the framework
2. **Framework introduction** (1-2 paragraphs): Name the framework and its core claims
3. **Extension rationale** (1-2 paragraphs): Why this framework should be extended to this new domain
4. **Study preview** (1 paragraph): Data and approach

### Theory/Literature Review
**Function**: Scaffolded as genealogy — what the tradition explains, what it can't yet explain, and how this study extends it.

**Structure**:
1. **Framework genealogy**: Origins, development, key figures, canonical studies
2. **What the framework explains well**: Its successes in existing domains
3. **What it cannot yet explain**: The new domain or phenomenon that remains outside its reach
4. **Extension proposal**: How this study extends the framework — which constructs apply, which need adaptation

**Key move**: The theory section should read as a respectful but ambitious engagement with a tradition — not a critique, but an extension.

### Methods
**Function**: Operationalize framework constructs in the new domain. The methods section must show how abstract framework concepts become measurable or observable.

### Findings
**Function**: Framework terms serve as analytic descriptors. Findings subsections use the framework's vocabulary to organize evidence.

**Structure**: Subsections correspond to framework constructs or mechanisms, showing each one operating in the new domain.

**Key move**: The framework must do analytical work — not just provide labels but actually illuminate patterns in the data.

### Conclusion
**Function**: Affirm that the framework works in the new domain, note boundary conditions, and specify contributions to the tradition.

**Structure**:
1. **Affirmation** (1-2 paragraphs): The framework works — here's what it reveals
2. **Contributions to the tradition** (1-2 paragraphs): What this extension adds to the framework's theoretical toolkit
3. **Boundary conditions** (1 paragraph): Where the framework may need adaptation in this domain
4. **Future extensions** (1 paragraph): Other domains the framework might illuminate

## Vocabulary Threading

Theory-Extension articles thread the framework's canonical vocabulary:

| Category | Examples | Required Sections |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| **Framework name** | "field theory," "inhabited institutions," "world polity theory" | Title/Abstract, Intro, Theory, Conclusion |
| **Canonical terms** | Key concepts from the framework's literature | Theory, Methods (operationalized), Findings (as descriptors), Conclusion |
| **Domain vocabulary** | The new empirical site | Intro opening, Methods, Findings, Conclusion |
| **Extension vocabulary** | "extending," "applying," "building on" | Intro, Conclusion |

**Threading pattern**: Framework terms are the most visible threading element — they appear in theory section headers and are recalled as analytic descriptors in findings.

## Signature Moves (Do This)

### 1. Name the Framework Early
The framework should be named in the abstract or first paragraph. The reader needs to know immediately what intellectual tradition this contributes to.

### 2. Build Genealogical Scaffolding
The theory section traces the framework's development: what it explains, what it can't yet explain, and how this study is the next step.

### 3. Use Framework Terms as Analytic Descriptors
Findings must use the framework's canonical vocabulary to organize evidence. This shows the framework works in the new domain.

### 4. Affirm and Note Boundary Conditions
The conclusion affirms the framework, specifies what this extension adds, and honestly notes where the framework needed adaptation.

## Prohibited Moves (Don't Do This)

### 1. Framework as Background Only
**Why to avoid**: If the framework is mentioned early but not used to organize findings, it's decoration. The framework must do analytical work throughout.

### 2. Abandoning Framework Vocabulary in Findings
**Why to avoid**: If findings use entirely new terminology instead of the framework's canonical terms, the extension claim is undermined.

### 3. Claiming the Framework Fails
**Why to avoid**: Theory-Extension articles affirm the framework. If evidence shows the framework doesn't work, that's a Factor-Identifying or Concept-Building article, not a Theory-Extension.

### 4. Extending Without Genealogy
**Why to avoid**: Skipping the intellectual history makes the extension feel arbitrary. The genealogy shows respect for the tradition and positions this work within it.

## Exemplar

Theory-Extension exemplars feature clear framework genealogies, operationalized constructs, and findings organized by framework terms. Strong examples apply a single named tradition (inhabited institutions, world polity theory, boundary work, cultural sociology) to a genuinely new empirical domain with full genealogical scaffolding.
