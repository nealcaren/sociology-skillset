## Why Threading Matters

90% of articles in the corpus thread 5-8 key terms across all sections — abstract, introduction, theory, methods, findings, and conclusion. This threading creates coherence: the reader encounters the same vocabulary framework throughout, building familiarity and reinforcing the contribution.

Articles with weak threading feel fragmented — as if the introduction, findings, and conclusion were written by different people with different framings.

## What to Thread

Each contribution type has distinctive threading categories:

### Process-Tracing
| Category | Example | Must Appear In |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| Mechanism name | "selective empathy" | Abstract, Intro, every Findings subsection, Conclusion |
| Stage vocabulary | "first step," "subsequently," "triggers" | Theory, Methods rationale, Findings |
| Domain vocabulary | Case-specific terms | Intro opening, Methods, Conclusion |
| Outcome vocabulary | What the mechanism produces | Abstract, last Findings subsection, Conclusion |

### Concept-Building
| Category | Example | Must Appear In |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| Coined term | "flexible austerity" | Title, Abstract, Intro, Findings headers, Conclusion |
| Dimension terms | Components of the concept | Theory, Findings subsections |
| Inadequacy terms | What existing concepts miss | Intro, Theory, Conclusion |
| Domain vocabulary | Case-specific terms | Intro, Methods, Conclusion portability |

### Factor-Identifying
| Category | Example | Must Appear In |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| Account labels | "the cultural explanation" | Intro, Theory headers, Findings verdicts, Conclusion |
| Adjudication terms | "contrary to," "fails to" | Findings, Conclusion |
| Winning-account terms | Key concepts from the winner | Abstract, Conclusion (dominant) |
| Puzzle vocabulary | The phenomenon explained | Intro opening, Conclusion return |

### Theory-Extension
| Category | Example | Must Appear In |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| Framework name | "inhabited institutions" | Title/Abstract, Intro, Theory, Conclusion |
| Canonical terms | Framework's key concepts | Theory, Methods, Findings descriptors, Conclusion |
| Domain vocabulary | The new empirical site | Intro, Methods, Findings, Conclusion |
| Extension vocabulary | "extending," "building on" | Intro, Conclusion |

### Gap-Filler
| Category | Example | Must Appear In |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| Gap vocabulary | "little research has" | Abstract, Intro, Theory |
| Enumeration | "first," "second," "third" | Intro, Conclusion |
| Contribution claims | "we contribute by" | Intro, Conclusion |
| Implication vocabulary | "these findings suggest" | Conclusion |

## How to Thread

### Step 1: Identify Your 5-8 Terms
From your contribution profile, select the terms that will echo across sections. Prioritize:
- The contribution's core term (mechanism name, coined concept, account labels, framework name)
- 2-3 supporting terms (dimensions, stages, domain terms)
- 1-2 framing terms (gap vocabulary, adjudication language, extension language)

### Step 2: Map Terms to Sections
Create a threading table:

| Term | Abstract | Intro | Theory | Methods | Findings | Conclusion |
|------|----------|-------|--------|---------|----------|------------|
| [core term] | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | | ✓ | ✓ |
| [support 1] | | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | |
| [support 2] | | | ✓ | | ✓ | ✓ |
| ... | | | | | | |

**Rules**:
- The core term must appear in at least 4 of 6 sections
- No section should lack all threading terms
- The abstract and conclusion should share the most terms (these are the bookends)

### Step 3: Check for Rogue Vocabulary
Look for terms that belong to a DIFFERENT contribution type appearing in your draft:
- Gap vocabulary ("first to," "little research has") in a Process-Tracing article
- Enumeration ("we contribute in three ways") in a Concept-Building article
- Framework genealogy in a Factor-Identifying article

Rogue vocabulary sends mixed signals about your contribution type. Replace it with vocabulary from your actual type.

### Step 4: Strengthen Weak Connections
If any section feels disconnected, add a threading callback:
- **Methods → Theory**: "To trace the [mechanism name] identified above, we..."
- **Findings → Introduction**: "Consistent with the [mechanism/concept] described in the introduction..."
- **Conclusion → Abstract**: Echo the abstract's core sentence in the conclusion's opening

## Threading Strength Benchmarks

| Strength | Criteria | Prevalence |
|----------|---------|------------|
| **Strong** | 5-8 terms echo across 4+ sections; core term in abstract + conclusion | 90% of corpus |
| **Moderate** | 3-4 terms; some sections disconnected | 10% of corpus |
| **Weak** | Fewer than 3 terms; sections feel independently written | Not observed in published articles |

**Target**: Strong threading. If your draft has moderate threading, the alignment audit (Phase 2) will identify specific gaps.

## Common Threading Mistakes

### 1. Section-Specific Vocabulary
**Problem**: Each section introduces new terms not used elsewhere.
**Fix**: Use the threading table to ensure terms recur. New terms should be defined in terms of existing threading vocabulary.

### 2. Synonyms Instead of Repetition
**Problem**: Using "mechanism," "process," "pathway," and "strategy" interchangeably.
**Fix**: Pick one core term and use it consistently. Occasional synonyms are fine, but the primary term should dominate.

### 3. Introduction-Conclusion Disconnect
**Problem**: The introduction promises one framing and the conclusion delivers another.
**Fix**: Write the abstract first, then ensure both introduction and conclusion echo its core vocabulary.

### 4. Methods as an Island
**Problem**: The methods section uses only technical vocabulary with no threading callbacks.
**Fix**: Frame design choices in terms of the contribution: "To trace the [mechanism]..." or "To build the concept of [term]..."
